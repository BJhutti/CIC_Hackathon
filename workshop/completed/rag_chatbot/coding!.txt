Do all of these first level courses need to be taken in the first year to apply for the honours? In other words, if I’m missing like 3 credits out of these requirements, would I still be able to apply for the honours and take the first level courses next years or does that mean I can’t apply?

Of course I felt pressured to listen to their whole schpeal, but then she was so pushy, and forcefully took my phone from me and tried to pressure me into voting right then and there. I was grabbing coffee and catching up with my family. She was so insistent about me voting and was like, “let me do it for you”, “I know the voting process can be confusing” with my phone.  I just hate how pushy these people are and just really don’t have respect for boundaries. From what I’ve heard from other friends’ experiences, this isn’t uncommon (and also it is not confusing to vote, so stop trying to steal my vote :/). It’s disrespectful of my time and my space and my voting autonomy. And it’s incredibly annoying. Why the fuck would I vote for \nTaushifa Shaikh after experiencing that?

They can achieve very little on improved transit, housing affordability and campus affordability, you'd be better off working with TransLink, local city councillors, and MLAs. Most of what they could achieve besides nebulous and unmeasurable lobbying has already been done. The AMS built a foodbank to help with affordability, they worked with TransLink to establish the upass, they built purpose rental websites for students at UBC.\n\n\n\n\n\nI told my friends running this year to stay the fuck out of it, they're graduating and it's not their problem what happens on campus anymore and they're making the choice to run anyway because they think they can make campus better when the likeliest outcome is they're forgotten in four years. You're complaining on Reddit that they're all garbage people for trying. Who do you think I respect more?",
            "I don’t see why you think they have no reason. They listed their reasons.\n\nI don’t see why you think it’s humiliating and shaming them. It’s very specifically saying they dislike their ideas.\n\nI don’t see why you mentioned young adults. Presumably we’re all around the same age as ubc students. I think we can all say things about our peers and it’s not like punching down our anything.",

It’s also just factually incorrect, nearly every single person mentioned how they want to help affordability, transportation, etc. OP isn’t trying to help the problem, and I think this post was not needed.",

Have you also considered how compatible your two attachment styles are? I personally tend to detach myself and feel suffocated if there are these kind of strong attachments, especially if this need wasn't communicated before. Being a student is hard af as there just isn't enough time for everything, even if you're good at time management. You might want to try giving them the benefit of the doubt, and understand that he probably has a lot on his plate and even though he might want to contact you more often, he might just be overwhelmed with other things right now. Depending on the person, going multiple hours or days without contact might feel fine, especially if they feel their relationship is stable and they have lots of trust and love for one another. He might feel that with you. But communication is key",
            "It's hard, but the way to build the relationships you want is to ask for what you need. This is not an uncommon problem, but it's also one that people are usually willing to work on--especially if they are interested in building a connection with you. You know what your heart needs, see if they want to show up for that and consider what (if any) room you have to grow around the same.",

That’s just how it works. \n\nAnd no, people don’t have lives THAT busy. They’re not CEO’s or some shit like most people are normal and spend a copious amount of time on their phone already so if you’re not getting responses it’s either cuz he doesn’t like you or he hates texting (in which case, communicate and figure out a way to call more or hangout more)",

            "I mean I TA a course that is only papers and have for 3 years. Nobody is only teaching 1 course, so if you're only teaching you provably have 40 hours a week to teach your classes + prep, hold office  hours, and grade. If you assign something due during finals season then maybe you gave an extra 10-12 hours, but you probably are teaching 3 or 4 classes, so that's easily 100 papers and so 50-100 hours with your timeline. Fair grade or not, it isn't tractable. But at UBC most classes have TAs. TAs get like 100-200 hours for the entire term, so that would mean potentially half their hours would go just to grading a term paper if they took an hour on each one. I'm telling you, no prof, TA, grader etc. is ever going to spend more than 15 or 20 mins on your paper.",
            "Hardly anyone is only teaching! I've been grading for over a decade now and 10-15 minutes is pretty standard even for longer essays. Spending more than half an hour on any one thing is death!!",

It measures how good you are in that course, and doesn't accurately measure how intelligent you are.\n\nI'd be lying if I said there wasn't any correlation, but it's not the simplistic \"Fail = dumb\" you may have heard of before.\n\nHeck, back in high school I did really poorly in grade 8 math. I'm now a stats major simply because I had a hard time adjusting to high school, and after that year I pulled my act together. Not saying it'll be as simple as the snap of a finger but it's entirely possible you can do it too.\n\nSee your professor, TA, etc and find where your problems lie in the coursework.

There’s some loose correlation in something like a course on mathematical logic or similar, but even then, you can be a Terry Tao level of genius and still not perform all that well without at least some studying in advance. Extraordinary intelligence will help, but it’s not all that’s necessary.",

            "Anyone here saying that exam/school performance does not equal intelligence is being a bit pedantic or disingenuous. Study after study has shown a statistically relevant correlation between generally accepted measures of intelligence and school performance. Yes, not everyone that is smart performs well at school, and not everyone who is 'stupid' performs poorly. Still, overall intelligence is very highly correlated with test, school, and job performance in the long run.\n\nThat said, please don't beat yourself up over a single test. You're at UBC; chances are you're in the range where it's not your intelligence limiting your test scores, but your study method, effort, or something else.",

            "Intelligence isn't easy to quantify at the best of times. It certainly can't be accurately represented with a single test of a single subject.\n\nThink about it. What *is* intelligence? Does emotional intelligence factor in? What about your ability in pub trivia night? Your ability to hold information in your long term memory? Your work ethic?\n\nIt's a very broad concept.",
            "Intelligence is just how good/consistently you are at making your goals happen with what you've been given (of course words can mean whatever you want but this is a pretty standard interpretation).\n\nWith the assumption that people put a high priority on grades (otherwise the question makes no sense), then good exam performance can be an indicator of intelligence, since it requires many cognitive skills that are useful in life (time management, memory, critical thinking, speed, strategy, learning), and doesn't get affected as much by physical ability. But it definitely doesn't even come close to testing every aspect of intelligence.",
            "No it does not and heres an example of why:\n\nBoard exams have a grade cutoff. No matter how well you do, if you don't reaxh the grade cutoff, you won't get your license and will have to retake.\n\nIn cases like this, you only have to know enough to pass, not be intelligent enough to pass.\n\nSure more nuanced things like \"the questions will require you to think critically\" but imo thats more of a case of rational thinking, and even a person who is not gifted academically can have great rational thinking skills.",
            "A little late to the party but I’d agree with some others on here. Tests are very poor gauges of intelligence. I know some people who get average grades who are incredibly intelligent thinkers, and I’ve met some straight-A people who honestly make me embarrassed to have worse overall grades than they do 😂",
            "There are exceptions but they largely correlate",
            "To add, the amount of time you have to study for a subject is also correlated (studying efficiency, mechanisms, support groups, etc) .

I honestly was excited for this, as I used to love writing and language arts was by far my best subject before uni, for as far as I was writing essays I was pretty much used to getting 95 to 100% on anything I wrote. Got 5's on my AP Lang and Lit exams too.\n\nBut honestly since starting university, I've kinda been struggling with it. I pretty much always get mid-high 70s on anything I hand in, I have issues proofreading and I often make a ton of unnoticed grammatical errors. In addition I always have been pretty bad for run on sentences, and honestly they seem to be getting worse lol. I also struggle to keep track of and properly cite sources. Even Ignoring the more technical stuff I just find writing a lot harder than it used to be, it takes me much longer and I tend to get bad writer's block.\n\nHas anyone found themselves in a similar position? What kind of stuff helped you improve? Any tips and tricks you've learned? I'd like to get at least >80s on the majority of my big essays this semester, but I don't see it happening ngl.",

            "High school assessment can vary greatly by teacher so take high school grades with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you're getting a low grade in university papers, it might be that the professor doesn't like how you structure your argument or finds that your paper lacks focus. You said you were good at writing 1000+ words in one sitting, but doing that can easily make you stray away from your original focus and make your paper lack cohesion. I suggest that you write out key points relevant to your argument, make sure they stay on topic, then expand each of them little by little. Write your statements briefly, then ask *why*. Explain it. Add proof/references. If you're below word count, keep asking *why*, until you have written enough detail. You might naturally find yourself over the word count by doing this, and *that's great*, because now you can trim down and polish your writing to only include the most relevant key points.\n\nAs for grammar, there's no shortcut. Practice. Practice writing **without a grammar correction tool** because it absolutely kills your ability to think. One trick I use that a high school English teacher taught me was to write a draft without fussing too much about details, take your mind off it and do something else, then come back later and read what you wrote. This way you clear your confirmation bias and you'll be able to read your own paper as if someone else wrote it, and mistakes show themselves.\n\nI'm the opposite of you — in high school I hated writing about random junk I had no interest in. I would lazily answer questions in one sentence and think there's nothing else to add. Later on, as I touched on topics I actually had interest in and writing no longer consisted of generating bloat to fulfill a dumb word count, I found writing to be pretty fun and engaging. GL, you might improve drastically if you change your approach.",

            "1: It sounds like you don't/barely proofread your own work if you've got tons of run-on sentences and grammatical errors. An easier way to get used to it is to take your draft (You are writing drafts right? Not just one mammoth session then hand it in? Right?), print it out, and go through it line by line using a ruler or piece of paper so you can only see one line at a time. It's tedious to begin with, but you have to train your brain to focus on a single line instead of basically skimming and catching the most egregious errors. It can also help quite a bit to read each line out loud. \n\n2: Citations. Use a citation manager like Zotero or Mendeley. I use Zotero, but I think Mendeley has the same functionality. Not only can it be a central spot to hold all of your pdfs, but you can annotate within the app, create a bibliography, and insert citations in whatever style you need through a plugin for Word and probably other word processors.  \n\n3: Writer's block: A prof I had at Emily Carr gave us this suggestion when writing a paper. Take your word count and decide how much each section is going to need. Then open a new file for each section and write that like it's own little essay. What this does is instead of having to write a 2500 word paper, you now have 4-5 smaller essays. So when you do get blocked, pick whatever section you find more interesting and get writing. Even if it's just off the top of your head, get something written and then edit it later. Remember those drafts? Yeah. Get used to using them. Vomit out a bunch of words just to get something out and get the words flowing. Then edit.\n\n4: Read, read, read, write, write, write. There are two ways to get better as a writer. Read academic articles closely. Don't just skim for the bit that you think will be on the exam. Actually read closely not just for content, but also for structure and style. To begin with you can try to emulate other writers, but as you progress and get more confident as a writer, more and more of your own voice will start to come through. The other way is of course to write more and more. And not just write an essay the night it's due, but take your time to go through drafts, finding your mistakes, and fixing them. Also, go to the writing center and/or check out some books on how to write academically. On Writing Well by William Zinsser is really good. A bit more advanced, but also great is Critical Reading and Writing for Postgraduates by Mike Wallace and Alison Wray.",
            "I think a lot of people feel this way. I certainly do at times. But I don't think it's a reflection of getting worse or dumber or anything - it's the opposite. I bet if you go back and read something you wrote in high school, it's... not great. I don't think it'll be bad, but it's probably not up to your current standards. \n\nIt seems like things aren't as easy, but you're actually probably just much more skilled now and noticing the mistakes you wouldn't have seen before in your work. \n\nIn essence, you're not getting worse. You're almost certainly getting better, [you've just passed the peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1358/1*VX_yFVny-8iHO22IwUgpDw.png)."

            "I'm sometimes involved in hiring and the application process can be a little dehumanizing I'd imagine, but on my end, for a recent position, we had about 70 applicants, where 60 or so had no relevant experience or skills, some of which didn't even bother updating their cover letter to reflect the job that they were applying for.\n\nOf the 10 that had some relevant experience, only 3 had enough that it was worth interviewing them. \n\nOf the interviewees, the reason they were coming to/staying in Vancouver is an unwritten factor I think even though it's not supposed to be. UBC does not pay enough for people to have a job here as the reason to stay in Vancouver, and so make sure you bring up that your partner got an awesome job here and so you plan on staying. Turnover at UBC is an epidemic problem and that will help your chances",
            "Ok thanks! Will look into it",
            "Honestly, 70 doesn't sound bad considering most were unrelated and untailored applications. So really you had like 10 applications.\n\nI worked in HR once and got 300 applications. 200 were not relevant. They were out of country. Or they were completely unrelated. Etc.\n\nJust how it was.",
            "That's some interesting stats there. Probs to you for keeping my hope up haha but I don't even know what the changes of getting to tell people I plan on to stay are cos that would take an interview to actually happen.",
            "Out of curiosity, if a person applies for multiple UBC positions. Let's say as an admin assistant within the department of sociology and another admin assistant post in Faculty of Arts Co Op office would it be known to the hiring Manager of both teams you applied to both?",
            "The pay issue is very role dependent, and you also have to remember that good m&p jobs come with great benefits and with a very rare defined benefit pension.",
            "This is what I did (and what about half the staff in our department did) Hiring solutions is a great way to try out different roles/ departments... Then when a permanent role comes up you can apply.\n\nTurnover can be high, but it's because people keep getting promoted into better roles, so that's a good thing. I've been promoted 5 times (two were temp promotions for Mat leave) in 7 years.",
            "Hey thanks for your comment and serious question, lets say im applying out of Canada coz the relocation isn't happening yet but will soon, what are the odds the hiring managers will make a pass on my cv because i have a foreign phone number but indicate in my online application that I have a work permit?",
            "It would be reasonable information to put in your cover letter! Good luck though, it's rough out there",
            "That would be findable information, but not for the hiring managers. It's all software controlled now and you only get to see the applications for the job that you are listed as on the search committee for.",
            "Totally. That's often the only thing keeping our staff around. We're in a technical field, so anyone working in our facility could make 20-40% more somewhere else, but the benefits make up for a lot of that. Especially maternity and pension. \n\nBut we have also lost a lot of good candidates after interviews once they stopped laughing at the salary offer.",
            "Oh yes, IT is underpaid. But given the layoff chaos that is tech in the private sector right now, at least you have stability",
            "Yeah I was thinking about that recently. I'm really blessed that way"

So like you said you panicked, I'd say browse through as many problems as you can, the more you see outside of an exam, the less new stuff you can come across in an exam. And yes PHYS 158 is one of the most difficult courses in first year. I'd make sure you really understand every topic before starting to work on it. And if you see anything that you don't understand, give it time so you can understand it.\n\nAs for general advice for this course, do the homework, do the pre-readings - I studied only using the textbook and it worked for me, make condensed notes for revision, go to office hours and the homework help sessions",

            "CK and Smith seem like the two clear choices people will pick between. Smith has a more progressive platform, but CK seems to know logistically how to get what he wants done given that he currently works in the AMS & is ex-EUS. I personally don't think AMS presidents are able to do much, but it seems that more of CK's platform could be accomplished than Smith's.\n\nSmith has an interesting perspective since she's worked in ResLife, but she has no AMS experience and I think Esme struggled unnecessarily and undeservedly because of that.\n\nNeither are bad choices, but I'm leaning towards CK because Smith taunted him during the debate saying \"people aren't ripping my signs down\". [Tone is paraphrased and my opinion.] I thought that wasn't very classy. However, a debate like that is a really high pressure environment and I don't think she's a bad person or an irredeemable candidate.\n\nMarx and the Bulldozer I wouldn't vote for myself. Marx I do not buy that they didn't tell their volunteers to rip down other candidates posters. Instead of acknowledging the harm they did, they tried to spin it that \"at least I'm being honest.\" The Bulldozer seems like a good person but with no intention of actually taking office.\n\nThis comment != endorsement. To acknowledge my bias, I'm also in engineering but have never worked with CK personally. I hope all four of them stick with AMS no matter the results, we need people who care as much as they do.",

            "Heya! Thought I'd leave my two cents on your impression as it is relevant to students' impressions of candidates - thanks for taking the time to watch the debate and give your thoughts.\n\nI agree with the broad strokes of what you wrote - CK definitely has a strong platform and is a solid candidate. As I've pointed out in the debate, however, many of his promises are impossible to fulfill or are outside of the scope of the President. The Exam Database (one of his larger goals) cannot be equitably enforced with his proposed opt-in system - some professors/faculty would choose to participate while others would not; as Brandyn said, UBC tried and failed to make a database like this in the past (with nearly double the budget CK is proposing) due to professors not participating *when it was mandated.* And when speaking about giving order to Council, he promised to make everyone \"feel safe\" - the rest of us were quick to point out that this isn't possible, especially in an institution that many currently feel excluded or harmed by.\n\nI've spoken to CK quite a few times outside of the debate and frankly think that he's a great person with a lot of wonderful characteristics, AMS know-how being one of them. My comment on the posters being ripped down was made without the knowledge that Brandyn's previous campaigners were the ones doing it. My use of that example was in response to a question by the moderator early on asking us how we would work with long-term staff at the AMS; I said that my fresh face and no previous history would allow for the relationships to start productively, and said that people felt so strongly against CK that they were already tearing down his posters and campaign materials. This isn't to say that his campaign doesn't have merit, but instead highlights the opposition to him that would exist from day one. That said, on \"class\" I feel it should be mentioned that during this hour-long conversation, he was quick to anger and was visibly frustrated with those beside him on stage. If you didn't watch the debate, I'd recommend taking a look at the crescendo throughout. I understand that he sees himself as the strongest candidate - and frankly, I can see why - but at the same time, when we're having conversations about equity and inclusion, it's disheartening to see his disregard for others' experiences.\n\nAgain, voting for CK would not be a mistake. We have different platforms, and we're offering different things to the student body. Like you said, its a high-pressure environment and a slip in composure shouldn't determine one's effectiveness in a position.",

Best choice for students in all faculties if they want commitment to them from the AMS. \nI’ve seen comments saying that some of his goals are out of reach. I understand this perspective coming from a student who has seen countless years of essentially no action from the AMS. CK has proven his capability to reach his goals. Even as more of a bystander in engineering, (I don’t participate/ follow a lot of activities/things going on) I have 100% seen benefits in my education and university experience as a direct result of the work CK has put in.",

As someone who's had to apply for the Professional Activities Fund multiple times, it's gotten notably better this year and I understand Kevin was a big part of that. Amy is also extremely strong with her multiple years of AMS Clubs experience - Admin seems like a natural step from that. I would probably vote for Kevin or Amy before Jai.",

Take a look at the ballot and he's the only one who even bothered to link a website with a full platform, that's gotta be the bare minimum when you're calling yourself qualified enough to be in charge of an organization with a budget over $30 million that represents 60k students."

You can fight against world hunger just by walking to class from the bus loop! You don't have to be super fit; the app will sync with your phone to count your steps, and you can even passively participate!**\n\nBut I'm calling on all the athletes, the gym rats, and the muscle homies to use those sick gains to help save children! Share your love for protein with the world! I'm calling on all my friends who have said they'll start working out, but they never do. DO IT FOR THE CHILDREN!\n\n**Registration Link:** [**https://link.movespring.com/join?orgCode=N8PVDYX6ZP&groupCode=WRE9RY**](https://link.movespring.com/join?orgCode=N8PVDYX6ZP&groupCode=WRE9RY)\n\n**Registration Code:** N8PVDYX6ZP\n\nThis is for a FNH 335: International Diet Project, but I'm working with World Vision Canada and Food For Famine Society, so **your participation will have a REAL IMPACT!**\n\nPlease, friends, I am a single student team, and it takes a village to save one life! Help me make this go big! Share, participate, and save lives! Much love to my UBC community! <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12lh0j1e4mlc1.jpg?width=1545&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22d1ed9e05352c2fbfee8f054fc8080cfd75c4e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifgtb9xf4mlc1.png?width=4307&format=png&auto=webp&s=f43138030e17c97f7fd9d349f9a9df568f1d2fe5",

But that’s not enough for y’all because you are just dying for someone to blame and dogpile on - to the point where the SJC is wasting time and resources on a bullshit lawsuit against an organization that isn’t even responsible for what happened.

The team at Hillel is lovely and they provide Jewish students with resources, services and statements which, frankly cannot be provided by any other institution. \n\nAnd I'm not mad at the SJC for \"suffering too loudly\" I'm mad at them at their consistent failure to work with, protect, and care about Jewish students and their efforts to marginalize us and kick our institutions off campus. I'm mad at the SJC for tokenizing me when I worked with them and for tokenizing other Jews as well. I'm mad at the SJC for attempting a blatant power grap. I'm mad at the SJC for prioritizing their hatred of Hillel over divestment and foodbank access.",
            "Hillel does not need to grovel at your feet to make you feel comfortable.",
            "> an AMS referendum can't force UBC to investigate.\n\nThat's another thing I was curious about, how would the process of the AMS affecting Hillel's lease go? Maybe the AMS couldn't force an investigation directly but I'm sure there had to be some sort of step in that direction. \n\n> Frankly, it seems like we're holding the victims to the highest bar here.\n\nMy concern is what's achievable and justifiable with whats publicly available. This isn't some interpersonal conflict at this point even if people were affected personally, this is a now-legal dispute between two organizations and in such a context things have to be justified with sufficient evidence and precedent on what punishments are acceptable.  You can't justify legal consequences with feelings that they lean one way based on interpretations of their behaviour, it needs to be more concrete.\n\n> There are a hundred low bars that Hillel could step over to give any sign at all that this isn't a systematic issue. Hillel won't even stop over the first purely symbolic bar, and apologize.\n\nAnd I think that's perfectly good to criticize them for, but you have to consider what an appropriate reaction by authorities to that failure on their end should be.",
            "Part of me died inside when the AMS suggested they could offer the same services as Hillel. I'm sure we can all trust a group of non-Jews to understand Jewish struggles, right? Hah.",
            "Not to make you more mad, but the SJC statement following the October 7th events left a lot to be desired. Social justice for marginalized people, some terms and conditions may apply.",

            "I was laughing my ass off when I saw that. Can't wait to see where the AMS is gonna put their Kosher kitchen!!!! Where is the Rabbi's office gonna be????",
            "Did they actually? Hilarious. Do they even know the services that Hillel provides?\nWhen did they say that?",
            "I was going to mention this as well. It is because of the SJC that I watched my classmates post “resistance is justified” while I was still watching my people be massacred.",
            "What was their statement?",
            "> The legal details are for the lawyers to hash out. If a referendum says that the AMS should cancel a lease, that just leads to people asking lawyers what it possible.\n\nIt's still a legal consequence given it concerns the status of a contract between two parties. Even if the referendum is not an explicit ending of it but an ask, it's still the seeking of a legal consequence. And I do think there should be a different standard of specificity for me asking about the situation vs a referendum thats to be actually voted on lol. \n\n> I guess I should also clarify that I never said this specific referendum was a good thing in practice, so we don't keep talking at cross purposes. I just ended up in this conversation because people were making broader statements about Hillel, the lawsuit, the lack of a UBC investigation, etc, that go beyond the exact referendum.\n\nThat's fair ig, it is a pretty interrelated topic thats hard to separate though. \n\n> If a non-campus organization on UBC attacks a student union organization, it seems reasonable on principle for someone to want to remove them from campus. \n\nYeah, I get the ire - but if we're kicking groups off campus entirely then the bar needs to be *far* higher than defamation that is not sufficiently proven to extend to the whole organization. There's tons of things to look at before you jump to the nuclear option and far more steps of proof that need to be met to be taken seriously. Say the lawsuit or an investigation proves that this is a systemic issue within Hillel, then I think you look at steps to solve that without ending their lease *first*. \n\nThe precedent of being able to try and force a group off campus entirely in this manner is just not acceptable. Like, let's take Hillel at face value here that it was just one guy given anything else is not proven - what's stopping some \"contractor\" in the SJC from doing the opposite to Hillel w/ a sticker that says \"Hillel loves *insert Israeli War crime*\" and trying to get the SJC kicked off campus for that even though the SJC insists it was just one person?",

Covers topics like Bloom Filters and HyperLogLog. Beware, it is heavy on stats/probability.\n\n**CPSC 436S - COMP SECURITY**\n\nAssignments are mostly CTF-style challenges, which are quite fun. This course requires perhaps the most broad and deep practical knowlege of any CS course I've taken so far (and that's a good thing). A couple weeks ago we were writing SQL injections and analyzing PHP code for vulnerablities. Last week we decompiled binary code to reverse engineer algorithms and patch bugs. Robert Xiao is great, and I genuinely look forward to going to class.\n\n**CPSC 427 - Video Game Programming**\n\nBuild a video game in a team of six. When I took this course, each team would present their progress updates to the class for each milestone, and we would have the opportunity to play other team's games. I really enjoyed seeing other team's games evolve over time. Since this course is so project-heavy, I highly recommend finding a good team in advance. Experience with C++, OpenGL, etc helps a lot.",

Dealing with cross-contamination has been rough so far, so would appreciate general tips/advice as well as knowing what you all are doing for living situations (alone, w/ celiac roomies, etc.)\n\nAlso, is anyone registered with Accessibility for celiac (like maybe priority housing?)

            "Yes, there is a celiac support group, called UBCeliacs! You can find it on IG under ubcceliacgroup \n\nThis my response from another post about housing from a while ago:\n\nThe dieticians on campus are \\*supposed\\* to reach out to celiacs and ask them if they would like to be placed in Rits. In my first year I was lucky to be in a 4-bedroom suite in Rits with 3 other celiacs but in recent years, they have placed celiacs with non-celiacs. Sometimes they group people with various allergies together, which can also be tricky. If you're applying to UBC, I strongly advise applying for priority housing with a letter from your doctor explaining why you need to live in a celiac-friendly environment. If you want to live in residence after year 1, you can apply for a studio in year-round housing (but don't wait because housing is really competitive and housing will not give you priority access for CD alone after first year!!!).  \nIf you're really sensitive, I wouldn't recommend the first year dining halls. It gets too busy during peak times and the knowledge depends on the staff who is working at the time. I know people who have been told their meal is safe and got sick :(  \nIf you're new to BC feel free to check out bcceliac.ca for more non-student Vancouver-based celiac support! They hold monthly dine outs and other events. @bcceliac on IG\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message! CD can be isolating :)",
            "One group that is definitely worth checking out is the [Disability United Collective](https://www.ubcduc.ca/)! Many of the folks there are well-versed with the inner-workings of UBC and will be happy to give you advice on stuff. \n\nI think priority housing would be a good thing to look into. I think it's a very valid reason. More details can be found here: [https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/applications/how-we-assign-rooms/priority-access/](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/applications/how-we-assign-rooms/priority-access/)\n\nYou do need to go through the CfA and other things, but it is possible! Good luck!",

Ever since 2nd year first term when I did it out of desperation, I figured it worked and ever since then I’ve used it as a crutch to fall back on if I’m behind. Most of my classes have a “first concession no documentation required” policy and I’ve been using it solely for midterms. I’m now a third year and I’ve done this… around 5-7 times across all of my classes. \n\nI’m a straight A/A+ student in science, so looking at my academic history I doubt many people at all would think that I’m neglectful of my work. But the truth is that I fall behind my classes a lot since I have a long commute and I can’t bring myself to get up in the morning and go to class when attendance is barely worth anything or worth nothing at all. This happens especially at the beginning of the term when I’m still in the “vacation mindset” and can’t bring myself to work. The pressure usually kicks in around the middle of the term and I make it in time for finals. Besides taking the make-up midterm or having the weight moved to the final… nothing else happens and life goes on.\n\nI’ve internally gaslit myself into thinking that the professors “probably don’t care, or that it’s the least of their worries” and that considering that concessions are designed to be fair, I don’t think they give anyone using them an edge. I have never had an issue with my productivity beyond midterms. But i’m worried that one day maybe it’ll catch up with me, since the concession forms that I have to fill out officially sometimes have the “you have to be truthful” clause, or that I’m causing my teachers a huge pain in the ass. And I really feel guilty, even more so of late. It would be nice if someone could give me some words either for or against my actions… ",

            "I appreciate you talking about this, and reflecting on it. \n\nThough the concessions are often designed to be fair, they are intended for people who legitimately need them, and there is a good faith assumption that people are being honest. In a very real way, submitting fraudulent reasons for concessions is academic misconduct. It is very hard for us to detect. There are times when we require documentation, and we do find fraudulent documents or inconsistencies that we pursue. \n\nThere is another potential impact in the situation if you applied for these concessions in the midterms, then had a issue for the final exam. If you had completed minimal coursework, we would deny you SD request and offer you a W if you were in good standing. If you were not in good standing, we would let your grade stand. This could delay your degree progression in something that could have been prevented if you showed up. \n\nAnother aspect of this that I would like to address is that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a real thing. Not being able to get up in the morning is a sign of this type of depression, and the facing the things things of a day can be a real challenge. I struggle with it myself, particularly when I was in university. One thing I did was set a light on a timer to turn on around 5:30 or so, to simulate the rising sun. My light was a rocket ship from when I was a kid, but they now have fancy lights that do this. This is a form of light therapy. There are also other things that you can do. \n\nIt might be a good idea to reach out to UBC Counselling (https://students.ubc.ca/health/counselling-services) either their direct services or Here2Talk, listed a little lower, to talk about it.",

I personally didn't agree with their platform (some of their initial promises were really unreasonable or kneejerk reactions), but I honestly thought and still believe that their heart was in the right place, and I am happy that someone like Esmé at least fought by their principles.",

            "Broadly: Robert's rules of Order are a set of rules and guidelines intended to streamline the process of conducting meetings and making decisions, especially within formal organization settings. They cover the conduct of a meeting: how motions are presented, debated, and voted on, as well as how people can participate in the decision-making process & discussion. You probably know them from political dramas, where characters say stuff like \"Point of Order\", \"I move to to amend\", etc. A major(-ish) criticism of Robert's Rules is that while it allows for orderly and efficient meetings, it can inadvertently reinforce existing power structures and hinder inclusive participation.\n\n\nSpecifically: the formal and procedural nature of the rules is not conducive to the cultural practices, communication styles, and decision-making processes of systemically marginalized groups, whom I assume in this instance to be indigenous groups. This is ostensibly a move towards making the AMS Council a more inclusive and equitable space, as it would allow for the adaptation of alternative modes of decision-making that are more consensus-based and culturally sensitive. \n\nFrankly: It would be incredibly irresponsible for the AMS to discontinue the use of Robert's Rules, especially considering that the referendum hasn't proposed an alternative. Given the sometimes... emotional nature of student politics, moving away from a formal structure could potentially make AMS Council meetings nothing more than formal screaming matches. Without a clear and well-understood alternative, getting rid of Robert's Rules while adding 99 (!) seats to an already large council is potentially the stupidest idea I've seen all year.",

So yes, the SJC is prematurely advocating to ruin a safe space for Jewish students on campus. That is anti-semitism. Once Hillel BC has been found liable for defamation by the courts, then perhaps discussions about this topic can proceed. But even so, Hillel BC has a lease for that site for another 60 years. If the referendum passes and the SJC removes Hillel from campus, that would likely be illegal and Hillel BC can sue. \n\n*Even if* Hillel BC has been found liable for defamation, Jewish students still deserve a safe space on campus, and Hillel is a global organization that provides such a space. I do want to clarify that I do not condone the stickers. \n\nOn a separate note, the SJC has failed to include Jewish students in their activism. Jews are among the most consistently targeted victims of hate crimes in Canada, and the SJC has consistently ignored that fact, neglecting to acknowledge the rising anti-semitism we’re seeing in Canada and around the world. There can be no ‘social justice’ when certain oppressed groups are excluded. \n\nSo yes, the combination of all of these factors makes the UBC SJC an anti-semitic organization.",

        "selftext": "Alright, I'm in my 5th year of CPEN and I think I can finally share my 2 cents on this debate:  \n\n\nWith the changes to CPEN the last few years, its no longer a \"don't do CPEN if you don't want to do hardware\". After second year intro you won't ever need to touch HW again, if you so choose\n\nIt actually just comes down to your learning style. If you are someone who wants EMPHASIS put on building projects, actually \"DOING\" stuff with all the theory -> do CPEN\n\nIf you really love the underlying math, the theory, the algorithms (I like to say, if you are someone who enjoys \"thinking\" about math) -> do CPSC\n\nI WILL SAY THOUGH, I think CPSC is at least a couple of levels easier than CPEN, regardless of your learning style. Something about the ECE profs just drains your soul. I've always really enjoyed going to CPSC lectures, but you couldn't pay me to listen to my CPEN profs drone. \n\nIt feels like CPEN profs are forced to teach, whereas the CPSC profs want to teach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, both good degrees for tech, CPSC probably the easier path for software (but harder to get into imo)",
        "comments": [
            "There’s a debate on this?\n\nCPEN literally teaches everything they teach in cs plus extra engineering stuff.  You also have more career options available after.  The only downside is it’s way harder.\n\nI’m in cs because I’m a second degree student and didn’t want to do another four years.\n\nYou have less room for comp sci electives in cpen, but it really won’t affect any career outcomes.  You’re not going to be able to work in AI just because you took 322 for example",
            "CPEN: comes with Mieszko \nCPSC: comes without Mieszko\n\nChoose wisely",
            "I AGREE it is much harder, lmao\n\nAll I remember ppl saying when I was choosing (yes long time ago I'll admit) was do CPSC if you wanna do software, CPEN if you wanna do hardware. Which I always thought was weird but I guess CPEN is really still part of ECE which is lower level\n\nPS I think a few years ago, one could definately do more software + ML/DSCI stuf with CS vs a CPEN degree. Recently CPEN has been acknowleding the AI/Software wave and has adapted as such, but was probably not the case in the past.\n\nThere's no SWE program at UBC so CPEN/CS is the best you can do",
            "CPEN’s AI/ML offerings are actually sad in how they are put together. \nCPEN 355 is absolutely not comparable to CPSC 340 because it’s an applications course, perhaps maybe you could consider it somewhere in line with CPSC 330 (which mind you is typically taken by non-majors) but it almost feels like the course is teaching sklearn.\nCPEN 400D/455 does the complete opposite and (imo) is taught as if it’s a grad level class where youre expected to come in with a very strong math/stats background unless you want to suffer. The tutorials for this class which could’ve been a redeeming part of it are structured so poorly and go on to just go over pytorch (which one could learn better off by following PyTorch documentation), for some reason they don’t care to supplement the math/statistics which is the bread and butter of the lectures. Also TAs are extremely unavailable and will take forever to respond to Piazza (and provide vague and unhelpful responses). \n\n(Going on a tagent here but in fact in general most CPEN TAs for upper year courses unfortunately are typically unhelpful (spare one TA whom I had for 355 and was an absolute gem). It feels outrageous because the counterparts in CS will at the very least try to help more.)\n\nSadly you will not get hired for AI/ML roles because you know how to call model.fit() and model.predict()\n\nThis is the reason why so many students still opt to take CPSC 340 which is often quoted as the best undergraduate level course among many departments. \nSo I disagree with the fact that they are comparable for AI/ML at present.",

Then first year, still procrastinated which wasn't gonna work anymore. I passed all my courses by somehow pulling through, but failed a midterm for the first time, was tired all the time  and couldn't get myself to work. \n\nThen, second year came and things went even more downhill. I took 5 courses instead of 4, was commuting from surrey, failed/barely passed all my midterms, couldn't get myself to do anything and even barely studied for finals. I was entering exams without even knowing half the topics. so inevitably i failed cell bio and o chem. \n\nNow second semester, I started counselling and live alot closer to campus. I am also taking meds for my anxiety because a likely cause of this issue is my fear of failure/perfectionism. I felt better this semester, but a mistake I made was thinking my meds were going to be a magic solution rather than a tool. So the same cycle repeated: I had two midterms and know I failed them (very badly) because I barely studied or not at all. One of those classes has a policy of if we do better on the final, that grade will be replaced and there's also a second midterm, so it's definitely not the end of the world. However, I am definitely fed up with myself because this is so unlike me. I want to do better the rest of the semester and do what I can. And now that I know my meds aren't a fix, I can look into strategies to make studying easier. However, I cannot help but feel guilty. I have a great life, my only commitment really is school, and yet I still can't sit down and use my full potential. I want to work hard and have good grades but I just can't. Like I honestly feel like a waste I'm not going to lie. \n\nSo does anyone have any advice on how to stop feeling so crappy about myself, some tips for getting through this, and any comeback stories? \n\n&#x200B;",

            "i feel you! i used to have the same issue w not studying for tests bc that way, if i fail, its not bc im stupid but bc i didnt study. but tbh i just had a epiphany after getting subpar grades my first semester that itd be rlly fucking embarrassing if future me had to look back and realize that i didnt accomplish anything not bc i tried and it didnt work out. but bc i not only didnt even try, i didnt try bc i wanted to not look stupid to ppl who weren’t even paying attention to whatever i was doing…… obviously it gets frustrating when u try hard and dont get the results ur hoping for right away, but trust me you’ll find ur way there eventually :) good luck! u can do this!",
            "I think the thing that helped me the most was focusing on the bigger picture - thinking about how I'll feel after the test if I study vs. if I don't. As well as my end goal for my degree. Also, I find it helps to study with someone. It's harder to procrastinate when there is someone else to hold you accountable. Pomodoro is also helpful sometimes or rewarding yourself after studying for so many hours. Setting goals can be a powerful tool.\n\nAs for feeling better about yourself, just know that what you're going through is something that a lot of people have experienced. These things are really, really hard to overcome, and being cruel to yourself won't help. Sometimes, when things are challenging, I imagine what some of my friends would say to me instead of what I would say to myself. My friends are honest, but they are not cruel, whereas I am my own worst critic, and my opinion will already be tainted by my construal of the situation. Your mind can be powerful, and if you contrue the situation as something you should be ashamed of, your brain will certainly make sure that's all you can think about. It is important to accept who you are, as you are. Good and bad, as we all have both. Only focusing on the good or the bad won't help because it's only part of the story. Once you accept where you actually are, then you can figure out where to go from there. \n\nIt takes practice, changing how you think doesn't happen overnight. But starting is the most important step. You can do this! I believe in you! You are not a waste of human.",
            "Keep your head up! You're not a waste, just facing a bump in the road. Focus on self-compassion, find study strategies that work for you, and don't hesitate to reach out for help. You've got this!",
            "I feel this! I was a poor student in high school, got my shit together in first 3 years of uni (85 average in my science degree), shit hit the fan (in my personal life), and my grades plummeted in my 4th and 5th years. I talked to some people in my future profession about how I was feeling and they gave me some words of encouragement which reignited the spark. Been doing a lot better since, trying to get on that damage control but eh you do what you can do."

            "Jesus this kid thinks he/she’s entitled. Those people have equally good reasons to take those courses, and they’re all under the same circumstance of having less years in their degree. So stop complaining about not having the liberty to chose any course you want, that’s just real life. I don’t know how smart you are, but you are not in anyway more entitled than a second, third or forth year in this specific scenario. Those courses are named 200+ 300+ since they’re intended for those year level students firstly. You can come after if there’s space. Besides if people with other majors are taking cpsc courses, they’re probably focusing enough on their major already, and you have no right to tell them to focus on it more. Lastly to argue another point you may potentially bring up, the department having anymore restricted seats in exchange for general ones would damage its reputation. One of this school’s strengths as a top institution is the variety of courses offered. So as someone else brought up, the cs department altering the portion of seats in the way mentioned would likely be perceived as gatekeeping by the rest of the ten thousands of students here. You will hopefully understand all of this once you’re older.",

He was extremely creepy and kept asking me questions about myself and when the semester ends and if I’m a student. The encounter felt really uncomfortable and I just had a bad vibe to it. He also kept licking his phone. He then asked me where I lived and I wasn’t gonna tell him that. I told him that I was getting off at Westbrook village cuz I was meeting a friend. Which was entirely a lie so I can get off and get the next bus but he was trying to get off at the same stop as me. Luckily he got off first and I stayed on the bus and I watched him walk away.

They rely on social norms keeping us from reacting yet immediately push our boundaries. Fuck that. \nIt's okay to make a scene. It's okay if it's awkward , it was the creep that made it awkward. It's okay to call in people around you. Be loud if you can.  Make big gestures like shooing away - it can instinctively make other people back up. If can feel scary at first, but saying \"you're making me uncomfortable\" \"please stop, you're being inappropriate\" can also feel powerful. \"This man is making me uncomfortable asking personal questions\" loud enough that people around you hear can also be a good route.

He drooled a lot and he was super close to me so it was a little uncomfortable but I ended up just getting off at my stop and he kept taking the bus.

You can always raid the blue bins behind the Chem building for amber glass bottles though. \n\nAs for electronics unfortunately UBC does a pretty good job of destroying most items of use before they throw it out, there's a large pile of electronics pending disposal in the basement of LSK but most things are intentionally broken.\n\nIf you want cheap glassware and apparatus AliExpress sells some for affordable prices. Other used lab equipment can sometimes be snagged at affordable prices on eBay as well.",

(OP says they own a MacBook which usually has good battery life)\n\nIt does take a small learning curve to write with a tablet. But even if it’s less natural, it is more ergonomic to be looking up instead of down.\n\nIt’s nice to have two screens for example to watch a zoom lecture on your laptop and annotate on your iPad. This is definitely something OP should consider. I have been fine with split screen. But when I’m at home, I connect my laptop to a second monitor. If OP wants an iPad mainly for digital note-taking, I still think a drawing tablet is a more flexible option.",

I received the trek excellence scholarship, science scholar 4x and went to the final round of interviews for the wesbrook scholarship. I have multiple volunteer and work activities on my resume and a first author publication. I've applied to 300+ jobs since graduating in May ranging from overqualified, qualified, and underqualified.

I don’t think very highly of UBC degrees but they definitely entail a higher pay than the average bachelor degree from local schools. \n\nI think your point regarding working in family businesses is the exception not the norm. You work at a family business for less with the expectation that one day you will own that business and reap the profits. You’ll also be supported by your parents and family. \n\nCan the economy sustain everyone making $30/hr? Probably not. Some degrees are simply less valued and get less pay. I do think that we see a lot of high value degrees head to the states for more opportunities, I also think degrees from schools like Capilano and Mount Royal University or Bow Valley College all command lower wages than UBC. I also think there’s a lot of people with bachelor’s who lack the drive to get more pay. Many people are in lower tier universities for the sake of the job and accept lower wages.",

            "Sometimes you can show up to the gym and do one little exercise. You can even go in and just stretch and leave! The gym isn’t too scary. \n\nI find it easiest to get back into anything by just making it less daunting in my head. There are no negative consequences of just showing up, and no requirements of what you need to do when you get there. \nAs for eating unhealthy, oh well. Sometimes you just have to enjoy some good grub! It’s truly spectacular how much food is available to us here and I’m sure those meals were awesome. For now, it’s about making healthier choices, which doesn’t mean you can’t eat some junk once in a while either. \nYou got it :)",
            "Your body will never be more primed to respond quickly and impressively to exercise than it is now. These are arguably the most physically attractive years of your life, don't waste them.\n\nEdit: go listen to Baz Luhrman’s Wear Sunscreen. Lot of motivating advice in there.",

They can't tense their muscles enough to get off the toilet by themselves. There's also associations between inactive lifestyles and a heightened chance for stroke, cardiovascular disease, blood clotting, muscular atrophy, and other forms of preventable disease. Your body deserves better than that. YOU deserve better than that.",
            "Take baby steps. Start by packing your workout clothes and just get yourself to the gym. You don’t have to workout if you don’t feel like it once you’re there, but there’s a high chance you’re gonna want to once you’ve spent the effort.\n\nThe key is to reduce your expectation to do things perfectly. I had a period where I was able to go to the gym every day just by having the simple goal of “getting there”. It took off so much pressure. Some days I literally only walked on the treadmill for 15-30mins or stretched.\n\nStart just by just getting yourself there. You got this!",
            "I find it helpful to think about the reason I am going to the gym and eating healthy - the goal I am working towards (deadlifting 2x my body weight). I've been working towards this goal for so long, and I'm so close, that I can't resist going to the gym. I missed the last week and a half of workouts due to a bachelor party then getting sick after the bachelor party. So frustrating to lose that progress but like I said I can't resist going back. Eventually the habit became so ingrained that now it's harder for me *not* to work out, than it is to work out. Do you have a goal you're working towards?",
            "Hey. Don’t worry, you got this. Take baby steps and I’m sure you’ll get into the routine. \n\nSet it on your calendar, go even if your impulse wants you to skip or go later. Don’t listen, just go at the time you originally decided to go. Exercise for an hour only, but just god damn start. That’s all that you’re gonna need, that kickstart. \n\nTrain your body to go X days a week (you choose that) at a specific time. Even when you feel lazy just don’t listen to your impulse. Go to the gym even with half a grumpy face, or even half asleep. Once you get into the routine, you’ll be able to find it in yourself to keep going back. \n\nFor eating healthy, honestly, meal prep saved my life.",

            "Well it's just good to eat healthy to avoid the many many health problems that come with a bad diet. \n\nMost people's motivation to go to the gym is less a health thing and more of a self image thing. If you're fine with your body and don't see any motivation for going to the gym that's fine.

This Friday, March 1st, we are going to be holding our largest fundraising event of the year, Relay for Life, at the Student Recreation Centre from 3:30 - 9:30pm!! At our RFL, we will have performances, activities, games, vendors, and speeches from cancer researchers and cancer survivors. Food, snacks, and drinks will also all be provided as well as a t-shirt. The event will honour those who have passed from cancer and anyone else who has been affected by the disease. We would love to see all of you at our event to help us fundraise and make a big impact for cancer researchers and patients alike!\n\nTo register, create a team, invite some friends to fill that team, and fundraise as a team. Even if you can’t attend the event, consider making a small donation because every dollar counts! There is a registration fee of $20 which will all go to the Canadian Cancer Society, along with every single dollar donated or fundraised. We’ve already raised $15,000 and we are trying to double that by the end of this week!! You can sign up at [relayforlife.ca/ubc](https://www.relayforlife.ca/ubc) and we are constantly posting updates for the event on our instagram, [ubc\\_ca](https://www.instagram.com/ubc_ca/).

When coyotes do encounter humans in the wild, almost always they will run away instead of attacking.\n\nKip especially, though, is very chill. He's used to being around a lot of humans, so he's very unlikely to jump at you. He's cautious around humans, but not afraid of us. He would make more of an effort to avoid humans if he was concerned about us. Kip is basically a tame coyote. Living on a university campus means that he's not really a wild animal at this point, but note that that doesn't mean that he's the same as, say, a dog, he's not domesticated. \n\nI've personally been within like 3 meters of him without him running at or away from me, and I don't think that's unusual. If Kip were going to attack a human, it would have already happened.\n\nI certainly wouldn't bring a dog near him, and trying to feed/pet him is probably not a good idea, but just passing by him between classes you're at about as much risk as walking by a stray cat. Employ social distancing with Kip and you'll be fine.",

            "Go to Douglas or KPU for two years!\n\nWhen I went to Douglas for 1 year, where there’s no scaling or curving, the opposite was true as everyone really tries to help one another and it creates this very friendly atmosphere where you feel supported by everyone, including your prof that’s never too busy to help you since there o my job is to teach at Douglas. \n\nProfs at Douglas and KPU actually mark all assignments and test, and thus are responsible for your entire grade since there’s no TAs as far, so as I know. Moreover, there’s only 25 to 30 kids max in most classes and like as low as 8 to 10. Many on here will say the prof teaching or material taught are lower quality, yet many of the profs they are hating on, at least the Canadians, received their PHDs from UBC, the majority actually did, and many of the non-Canadians went to schools as prestigious as many of the profs here, but for one reason or another, they decided they didn’t want to continue to publish and focused on teaching. Yes the average student at Douglas is less intelligent since acceptance criteria is much lower, and yes the prestige is negative to negligent at best, but the services offered by the school and level of prof is equal, if not better, due to the one on one opportunities to engage with a PhD professor with decades of experience teaching and specifically marking and/or working in the field; ubc profs usually have little actual, practical experience in professions related to their field on study/instruction, for example, the number of hours worked as a clinical psychologist, Id assume, is far greater amongst Douglas profs compared to their colleagues at UBC since the majority at UBC come straight from academia and if they work clinical hours they are likely through UBC’s clinical and constitute a fraction of that profs time. Conversely, at UBC, you pay more money to have your paper graded by master students who have been grading papers for 1/100th of the time as Douglas or KPU profs have. By the same token, some classes, with 100s of students, are taught by PHD students, yet there’s so many kids in the class that it fills two lecture halls, while the equivalently recognized course by UBC, according to the BC transfer guide, at Douglas or KPU will have a full PHD prof lecture, grading, and answering all course based questions, with roughly more than 30 students per course. If you care about the prestige, which honestly doesn’t matter to anybody but you and your family while an undergrad, then transfer to UBC from KPU or Douglas after two full years, 60 credits, as by that point you’ll be passed the 100-299 level first and second year courses that are sometimes taught by PHD student and have all their tutorial led often by master students that know less on certain topics, in my humble opinion, than passionate undergrad students knows about a topic if the undergrad students are more read on the topic than the masters student, yet these masters students, maybe grading papers for the first time, and thus that inexperienced putz will have the fate of your scholarship gpa and maybe even the fate of whether you are accepted to law or grad school in their hands. However, we are taught we should accept they know what they are doing as they had a few hours of instruction on how to grade a paper…well sometimes these students think only their own papers are worthy of an A, imho, as that’s all the experience they have to go on and haven’t really seen enough papers to know who’s/what’s worthy of an A and a B quality and so on yet since it takes years of experience to prefect the skill to the point all students’ papers are treated equally, especially if the student writes a paper at odds with the TA’s beliefs and the TA marking it is inexperienced TA, and all TAs, imho,  are inexperienced markers since most are masters students and thus have only 1-2 years of experience marking, on average, with a max, in most cases, of 3 years of experience as a TA grading student works. Therefore, if a master student is grading your paper, figure out what their beliefs are and write a paper that mirrors them if you want any chance of receiving an A. Sorry for going off topic but hopefully it benefits one person by convincing them to stay or go to Douglas for the first two years, as I wish I had stayed and extra year, or, at a minimum, I hope my tangent convinces someone to drop writing a paper that disagrees with their TA stated beliefs in favour of one that adheres to their TA’s beliefs if they know that course will affect their grad school or law school application, as UBC law uses students entire CGPA with the three or four lowest gpa courses omitted from their CGPA admission. \n\nIf this post helped anyone, let me know, as I spent over and hour thinking about it and then writing it! That’s why I couldn’t edit it any better, as I’m out of time and have to go to class now!",
            "Go to Uvic as even though everything Dr Cheung said is mostly true….I’m sorry to break the doctors heart but UBC psych is the worst program at UBC, even if it’s ranked 1 or 2 in the country and top 20ish in the world, for the simple fact: \n\nUBC PSYC IS GRADED ON A CURVE or “curved”; \n\nin the same way SFU business is the worst program at SFU since it’s graded on a curve, UBC psych is the worst program at UBC because it’s graded on a curve. \n\nThat means in many, if not all, of your psych courses, regardless of how students do on assignments and test, how many students get an A, B, C, and every grade above, below, and in between is already determined before the course’s first date based on how many students are enrolled. \n\nI’ve never understood why a student shouldn’t get an A if they know 87% of the material the prof decides is important and thus presents during lectures, includes on tests, or designs assignments around. \n\nUvic actually has a policy against any prof curving grades, or at least that’s what I’ve been told by students I know who go or have gone there. There’s also post on Reddit of psych students saying that curving is banned, at least in the psych department. Many of those posts are recent so I assume that is still the policy. \n\nImo, curving grades turns education into a competition. Many of the arguments I’ve heard for why curving grades and this turning grading into a competition are good revolving around preventing grade inflation and thus making grade school admission easier for the grad admins  department to distinguish between top, deserving of admission  over all the other, lower scoring, students. However, THAT ARGUMENT MAKES LITTLE TO NO SENSE UNLESS ALL PSYCH UNDERGRAD DEPARTMENTS UBC ACCEPTS STUDENTS FROM ALSO GRADE ON THE CURVE, and as far as I understand, almost no other universities’ psych departments, at least in Canada, grade on a curve. The curving of grades also harms psych students wanting to go into law, even versus other UBC students since only a few other departments curve grades, like CS, and for those departments, curving usually increases those students grades, as is the case with CS from what I understand. \n\nIt would be nice if there was a guide that listed all of the departments that curve grades at Canadian universities.",
            "Seriously though, lmk if you have questions! And are you referring to undergrad or grad? Because students don’t apply to the undergrad PSYC program.",

            "Hi Ben",
            "Hi Ben",
            "Please Dr Ben fight to get rid of the garbage policy of scaling/curving, as Uvic doesn’t have it and UoT has something similar yet still many miles ahead of the curve compared to UBC’a antiquated scaling policy that ruins the core purpose of education, as yes I’ve read the department essay saying that grades aren’t a measure of knowledge, but it’s still an unfair practice so long as students at a school that doesn’t implement a similar policy, such as Uvic, are assed equally for grad school programs in psychology by UBC admin. Unless I am wrong at Uvic students are assed lower in terms of life gpa than UBC and other curved programs, it seems unfair. \n\nUBC, to my eternal surprise, is updating their arts requirements, meaning no more of the hated language policy, which could require some students having to take up to four language courses, such as 4 French courses, equaling 10% of total courses, when those courses could be better spent on electives beneficial to one’s career, such as a communication course for a psych student wanting to learn how to better communicate with patients and or those patients loved ones or toward a writing course for those wanting to further their education and thus need great writing skills to write the best possible thesis. The new policy is great and gives me hope that UBC is capable of improving their policies even if history has proven UBC is often many years late in making these updates and thus rigid compared to schools with a smaller bureaucracy.  Hopefully the same will one day happen with the, imo, unfair and antiquated policy of curving grades. If a student scores 90%, give that student 90%, and if too many students are scoring high than redesign the courses, but an artificial cap on grades is, to me, antithetical to the purpose to university and education. If school is going to be an open competition, let’s standardize it across all public universities, or at least preference that universities own students for grad school programs, as to keep the equality of education fair across all institutions regardless of how they grade. The final part goes beyond no curving or curving at all institutions, at least in Canada, or preferring students that completed undergraduate studies at the same university, but also delves into, in theory, using a standardized grading scale, as it makes no sense an A+ is 95%, an A 90-94%% and so on at some schools yet an A+ is 90%, an A 85-89%, and so on at other schools. The system is broken in terms of equity, or fairness, yet, no matter the argument, curving is the least equitable in terms of scholarships to grad school admissions. \n\nYou might be confused as to parts of my reply which may necessitate reading my other, much longer posts on this thread that I spent over two hours writing, sadly.",

            "I wrote a little more: \n\nTo me it’s wild that BC’s two most prestigious schools, SFU and UBC, have many deflationary policies, aka curved grading, for a variety of programs, especially when those policies are causing grades to deflate. Even when schools curve grades upward, it seems odd, as why not place a focus on course works, teaching techniques, and a combination of other practices that will result in students scoring greases accurate with their intelligence and work ethic. Nevertheless, curving upwards at least makes sense as it means the student at the top of his class is rewarded with a grade that will lead, if they do choose and continue to score at the top of their class, to a seat in a graduate program of the same subject nor will it damage their prospects of admission to a general program, namely law. However, to scale downward only leads to negative outcomes, which I’ll discuss below, and is why the majority of the most prestigious school, at least in NA, have abolished deflationary policies with better teaching practices designed to separate A students from B students without unfairly harming a student that scores 90% but is dropped multiple grade level by, say, having a freakishly intelligent class where multiple students scored above 90%, yet the same class with the same prof next semester has a freakishly low, as low as a school like UBC will have, intelligent class and a student scoring 80% on the exact same material as the students in the previous semester ends up with an A+, 90+%. Hopefully my simplistic example coupled with the fact that many, if not most, of the most prestigious schools, such as Princeton in American and UoT in Canada, have eliminated deflation policies, of which curving or scaling is one of the most common, maybe even the most common policy/method utilized, and thus most commonly thought of, pertaining to deflationary policies/methods in education, especially higher education, shows the antiquated and inequitable nature of curving. UoT does have a calibration policy, but it is at the discretion of the professor and needs to be able to be defended against valid questions from any student subjected to the calibration method or any school official interested in why/how that course’s calibration of grades was established, which seems much more defensible than UBC where students seem to have no recourse or anyway to challenge unfair curving that seems to be a true bell curve based on my experience at UBC while the Bell curve is actually banned at UoT and scaling of any kind banned at Uvic.",
            "Yah no this sucks but my high school subjects are all graded on a curve so I think I’d be a bit prepared for it at least! Oh it’d be so nice for a list like that oml and I agree it’s the worst since it makes everything so competitive. I really appreciate the advice I’ll seriously consider it esp since it’s university level not high school!",

            "Do the virtual tours on each schools websites, see what you can find on YouTube, and go to Google maps on your computer and “walk” around at street level. But my personal opinion is, take the full scholarship at Uvic. Where you go for grad school is much more important than where you go for undergrad.",
            "one day i might take a course of yours and then it will not be slander 😳",
            "Finally piece: \n\n\nBeyond the grad school issue that I already explained in detail above, proponents say that scaling is used to keep scholarships fair across courses and professors of the same courses, such as psych 217 that all psych students must take; however, as an ardent opponent, there’s many more school wide and school/department-irrelevant scholarship that any student subject to scaling in a majority of their courses, which is the case for all UBC psych students across for the majority of their degrees as they’ll take a majority of psychology courses, will be at a major disadvantage to any student not facing scaling, as psych scaling is a deflationary policy, so almost all scaling is downward and thus if you got 90% terms gpa that’s scaled down to 80% term gpa while a history student scored at 81% term gpa, the history student will get the scholarship, all else equal, because his department/program doesn’t scale, for student reliant on scholarship it hardly seems fair as I’ve read nothing on UBC scholarship having a way to balance this unfair/unequal practice out for scholarships open to all students of any program/department or even arts wide scholarships, as most arts programs/departments are not scaled…..For community wide scholarships, the same thing is true, but it’s worse, as at least UBC psych students are equal in terms of psych specific scholarships; however, a Uvic student with a 81% term gpa has the same advantage in terms of receiving all community wide scholarships, including psych student only ones, over the UBC psych student that was scaled down from a 90% to an 80% gpa term average as the UBC history student had over the aforementioned UBC psych student in terms of UBC student scholarships. Therefore, scaling/curving has disadvantaged the UBC psych student to the point they are disadvantaged in terms of all community wide scholarship, including psych ones, and all non-psych UBC scholarships, and thus a UBC psych student only has equality in terms of UBC psych scholarships and no other types of scholarships what so ever……….\n\nOn a personal and social level, it seems that no one wants to make friends or even be friendly outside their friends circle, beyond the common pleasantries and niceties of saying hello or holding the door open, as everyone sees everyone else as competition for the limited amount of predetermined A and B grades. Therefore, if you come to UBC and miss a class, don’t expect any top students to respond to your email asking for notes if you miss a day of class unless you have a good friend in that class. You’ll literally have to horse trade with someone who has worthwhile notes in order to obtain access to those notes, such as if they also miss a class.",
            "Is that a joke in reference to how Wendy's announced that, like Uber, they plan to have surge pricing?\n\nI thought that was such a messed up announcement that I looked more into it as I didn't fully believe that fast food would implement the Uber model...\n\nBasically  if you want Wendy's food at lunch or dinner, the most popular times of the day, it will cost more than it does right now since it cost the same at all times now and always has been a standard price; how much more will Wendy's charge at prime time, also known as the regular time periods in the day most people eat their dinner and lunch, respectively, at, honestly,  who knows? It is scary to think that on holiday's or what ever times alot of people get fast food, idunno say new years before the going to the club?, it may end up costing 20x the cost on regular, non holiday days. \n\nIt's like how an Uber can cost 10-20x as much when you try and request one outside of a stadium after a massive act,like Drake, just finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWendy's got so much backlash they said they aren't and won't ever use the direct uber model, so the new plan is to just jack the prices up like 10x but say their will always be coupons on the app, that way they get everyone to sign up for their app or pay a fortune for food, yet the coupons will either sell out at dinner time when they want less people to order nuggets and more people getting beyond burger, while at midnight or close to closing the coupons will practically give the food away as they'd rather get 20% for patties about to go into the \"trash\" (employees mouth) than make nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ncrazy world we live in.

            "hello! I just applied for the BEd program for the 2024/2025 year - some places you can get your hours are through programs like girl guides/Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts (they usually have groups that are secondary school aged), as well as places like the YMCA or YWCA. I would also look into family services and see if they have any youth programs that are accepting volunteers! As well as any sort of niche that you may be interested in or apart of - places like QMUNITY run youth programs, etc",

I worked with a lot of high school students, so you can definitely get a lot of experience here, and they might be some remote positions after august you can check out ☺️",
            "Apply for summer camps! I know SFU is currently hiring, and  they have many camps that cater to different teaching backgrounds.\n\nUBC also has camps, but I think they focus more on science, and it may be difficult to teach without a science background.",

I had a good relationship with a teacher and she recommended I do so to get my hours. I’ve been volunteering for 2 years and the hours accumulate quick! It’s also nice since we finish school 2 months before high schools do and you can volunteer during that time. I’ve worked with a range of grades and special needs students as well, it’s great experience. You could try doing the same in the US and get hours there instead since you’re moving there. Email a couple school principals and I’m sure they’d be happy for the extra help. As long as there is records of the hours, it should count.",

Here’s my monthly Senate recap!\n\n[Here](https://ubyssey.ca/opinion/senate-recentred-new-enrolment-targets-academic-offerings-and-course-standings/) is a pre-meeting report me and two other student senators authored, and [here](https://x.com/kareemhassib/status/1761583010384842878?s=46&t=YiyD9dgNfo7nzmYCb0Ki7w) is a twitter/X thread with relevant images.\n\nYou can find the senate docket [here](https://senate.ubc.ca/files/20240221-Senate-Materials-1.pdf).\n\nThis was a content-heavy meeting, since Senate didn’t meet last month. Here’s some highlights I think may be of interest to students:\n\nThe first things we did was go over an information item - the 2023 Enrolment Report. The report goes over headcounts, admission/yeild rates, retention rates, enrolment by Faculty and Degree, demographic data (gender, place of origin, indigenous identity), and much more.\n\nThe biggest finding in my opinion is that due to many geopolitical and economic factors, international enrolment has notably declined, while domestic enrolment is steady.\n\nA fascinating read; docket pages 17-82 if you're interested.\n\nNext years Enrolment Targets got approved, and are now being sent off to the Board of Governors for final approval.\n\nWe approved a new Master's of Global Health! Offered through the School of Population and Public Health and has support from industry professionals. This program will meets increasing demand in the public health sector and is the third of its kind nationwide.\n\nAlso approved was a new Graduate Certificate in Migration Studies, which came as a result of increased student demand, and is targeted to grad students interested in looking at mobilities and migration from an interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nWe then slightly modified deadlines pertaining to graduation for this summer, so we can have everyone graduate through SISC, our current student information system, before the implementation of Workday Student.\n\nAlso corresponding to our information system turnover, there are new course standings that you may see on your transcript next year.\n\nWe also approved numerous new awards and funding opportunities, as well as many cool courses!\n\nThere are far too many courses to list here, but some of my favourites include Topics in Indigenous Asia (ASIA 553), Applied Machine Learning for Construction and Facility Management (CIVL 427), Oceanic Geographies: Movement, Materiality, and Mobility (GEOG 492), History Through Video Games (HIST 204), and The Islamic Golden Age (HIST 362).\n\nThere was a presentation on “Academic Futures,”one of UBC's many strategic planning documents/initiatives. The document doesn't get into the nitty gritty, but is comprehensive, proposes interesting experimental ideas, and puts a large emphasis on EDI initiatives and climate action.\n\nFinally, we looked at finalized key dates for the next academic year (docket page 318-319).\n\nAnd that’s it, thanks for reading!",

            "Planning for a large university (or even cities) are much more difficult though (I am a civil engineering student). One key thing for urban planning is ensuring a balanced distribution between the infrastructure for amenities and that for research and teaching facilities, as well as for living. It is almost impossible to have a good population density, enough natural space, good amenities that are not too crowded, while subsidizing housing to keep everything cheaper. Given the current on-campus population of approximately 13,000 residents (resident stats)—excluding those in areas like Western Parkway or Westbrook—the strain on existing resources is already evident. For instance, the long wait times for hospital appointments, often extending to two months, highlight the pressure on healthcare services. Assuming a scenario where every member of the university community opts to live on campus (which is not true), the demand for healthcare services alone would necessitate the addition of at least four hospitals and corresponding medical staff. This scenario illustrates the broader issue of scaling public infrastructure to meet the needs of an expanding campus population, a challenge that appears daunting under current conditions.\n\nThus, its not that the university doesnt want to build more housing. It is just there will be too many trade offs that comes with it that make it not worth it (for example, less infrastucture, health care for everyone, much larger budget to subsidize all this cheaper housing, larger budget to maintain/clean the housing, etc)",
            "What about us commuters? 😶",
            "r/ubc *how goddamn dare they raise tuition by 2%!!!*\n\nalso r/ubc *shrink the student population!!!*",
            "Well doing that seems like a pretty naïve and super \"linear\" approach. Admit anyone who deserves to be admitted and let them make the final decision (taking housing and stuff into account) \n\nWouldn't be smart to cut people off just because they won't be able to live specifically on campus!\n\nPlus there is no \"we\" here! UBC is a profit-seeking organization and will do whatever generates more profit. What the alumni, current students and future students think is absolutely irrelevant.",
            "Appreciate your insight :)\n\n do you think admitting slightly fewer students or just not increasing the amount admitted each year would have a good impact, or would that cause other problems?",
            "Oh man. For health care, I’m not sure on campus housing has as big an impact as you think. I think the issue is that there is a family doctor crisis so the commuter students are using it too. Even without the crisis, it’s pretty convenient and I find the doctors at SHS are better equipped to deal with typical student issues (since that’s all they do all day). I was a commuter student for both my degrees at UBC and used student health family doctors, despite having a family doctor off campus (because she’s not the best and she is kinda far away).",
            "Why does everyone forget about commuters, theres more of us 😭",
            "Honestly it is a complicated situation.\n\nMore students -> gain more tuition, but higher population density (worse overall experience for students)\n\nLess students -> gain less tuition (probabality have to raise tuition to make up for this), but lower population density (better overall experience for students)\n\nSo at the 2 extremes, if we admit less students, we will turn in to something similar to the rich expensive private schools in the USA/europe - we will have a small amount of students (less accesible education), paying high tuitions, while having a higher quality education with much more amenities and infrastructure. If we admit more students each year, like we currently do, we will turn into a common wealth education, with relatively cheaper tuition but very litter job/research oppurtinities, worst living conditions, and lower quality education. We will always have to make a tradeoff at the end of the day (thats how economics work). Which trade off is more preferable to society, the school, and the students? Thus there is no simple answer to whether we will have a good impact or whatnot, because there will always be drawbacks."

I never really had friends before coming here and im pretty anxious with new people so i thought it would maybe be a good idea to try to be more social. The thing is that im a couple of years younger than them but idk if they know that since they havent known me that long and never asked (theyre 19 and 20 and im 16). Im worried that since its an end of the break party that its gonna be kinda crazy or whatever and since im usually really anxious around people that i wont be able to handle it. \n\nIs that something i should be worried about? Or are college parties at UBC more safe than like movies and stuff? I wanna go but i dont want it to be a bad time. Is there a way i could tell if its gonna be too much before going? \n\nTy for any help from anyone ",

            "College parties at UBC can vary, but most are safe. Trust your gut and set a sober buddy/leave plan.",
            "I’ve never felt unsafe at a party (other than frats) here but it’s such a big school that I don’t think you can really generalize. It truly depends on the size and vibe. I would recommend just sticking with your friends and either not drinking or only having a couple drinks. It’s great to try new things but also if you hate it that’s totally fine. Have a safe plan for getting home, if you are having a bad time/feel unsafe there is no shame in dipping!",
            "interesting. Not sure what UBC policies are, but it is a grey area to have minors attend a party on campus when there is alcohol. Especially since at frats they will ask to check UBC ID and take a photo of everyone going in at the larger parties. There was some negative press attention about underage girls being assaulted at frat parties so this is something that they are paying more attention to.\n\nIf it is a residence party people may let it slide if you are discreet...",
            "Are you from university transition program by any chance....? Haha sameee and I've felt that way too ",
            "Like other commenters said, depends on the people. I went to smaller parties with my friends when I was in first year (15 years old) and it was fun, but no way would I have gone to a huge party or a frat at the time because my anxiety would’ve made it awful. Even nowadays I avoid super big parties because they’re just not my jam, and I avoid frats because they have a bad rap for a reason. Just make sure to stay safe and make good decisions! (All the standard stuff of don’t drink from something that was opened by someone else or that you took your eyes off of at any point, don’t drive after drinking or get into a car with someone who has been drinking, stick with your friends, make sure you have a plan to get home safely, etc etc). Have fun!",
            "I’ve been to a lot of parties. If you’re a guy you’re 100 percent safe, if you’re a girl you’re like 99.9 percent safe but obviously take precautions stick with your friends don’t accept drinks you haven’t seen poured etc.",
            "Is a leave plan like just having someone to drive me home?",
            "Tysm. I'll ask to see if its a frat party and i think i'll try it if it isnt. Ty for your answer",
            "Oh thats actually really good to know. Ig i never thought about like id and stuff for a party. I think its at a house somewhere but idk if its on campus. I'll find out tho. Ty for the heads up",
            "People start uni at 15 now?",
            "Tysm for the advice. I texted one of them and asked if its a frat party and im not going if it is. And i can always call my bf if i need him to come get me so ik i can get home safe no matter what. Ty for the safety tips too.",
            "If you can, sure, but it could also mean knowing about and having a way to access an Uber/bus route home that still runs late at night that’s safe for you and your friends. \n\nI agree with the other commenters here: trust your gut, stick with your friends at all times (including to bathrooms, depending on the size of the party), and if you ever feel unsafe, there’s no shame in leaving (though make sure you have a way to get home safe, and that your friends also have a way to get home safe/stay safe and that nobody is left alone anywhere). \n\nCollege parties can definitely vary; it’s a large campus with a lot of people and I wouldn’t want to overgeneralize. I’ve personally never felt unsafe at any, but I would still recommend staying vigilant, sticking together and having fun :)",
            "Most don’t, some do. It’s a long story.",
            "No worries!",
            "Sorry! I forgot to say tysm for your advice. It was all good and i had a lot of fun and the advice you told me helped me feel a lot safer. Ty!",

IDK I'm not a biologist but it sounds reasonable that from an X and a Y chromosome (which is what I have) you can do artificial recombination to create genetically unique offspring.

            "I see what you're saying, since a bad flu is also about 1/3000.\n\n**but** let's keep in mind that the mortality rate from influenza(also most diseases&illnesses) is the highest among those aged **65 years and older**, aka the ones who are already weaker & more vulnerable, whereas the mortality rate from flu for people who are **18-49**, is **extremely low**.\n\nFrom giving birth? The mortality rate barely discriminates due to age. You could be perfectly healthy and still die from it. Plus, the chance to die from giving birth is much higher than winning in a lottery ticket, and that sounds like an high enough chance to me.\n\nand speaking from the 1/3000 rate alone, myself and many people have personally heard of a family or friend member who lost a loved one from childbirth, and giving birth is mostly **by choice and not by chance**. Which makes the 1/3000 much higher than it sounds like.\n\nlet's not forget that the organs get rearranged during pregnancy and there are life-long physical and mental consequences that every mother would have to go through, it's too much of a sacrifice for someone who don't even like kids, it's a long torture and I respect those who choose to have children, but saying it's not that high of a risk, nah I don't agree.",
            "Oh yeah for me too, as i am also trans. For some people it isnt dysphoric at all, or still something they want to explore, such as the lovely mascs on r/ seahorse dads!",
            "Correct me if I’m wrong but a lot of the time isn’t there screening and check ups that let you know if there are potential complications that could occur when you give birth? Whereas for something like the flu it’s not like you can just terminate it the way you can for a pregnancy. \n\nWhen you’re talking about things like organs moving around and all that that’s still not mortality. I completely agree that pregnancy is a messy and complicated process with many risks and because of that I am also choosing to be child free. But what we originally were talking about is mortality rates not all of the other potential risks.",
            "Again, as I mentioned, you could enter the delivery room passing all checks, and still participate in the 1/3000 death rate. Also, the screenings are to check if the baby has diseases or defects, search it up."

UBC and to an extent vancouver is somewhat infamous for being a difficult place to casually socialize and find friends. after my second year i transferred to a smaller program at mcgill and both the city and the program were both a much better fit for me and i was able to make much more of a home and community for myself here. not saying it’s a magic cure, but something to consider while you figure out a path forward! best of luck!",
            "You have a boyfriend and two friends? That's pretty good for UBC.",
            "Hi OP. Sorry to hear about this. The issue is not the university, but it's you. Thus, transferring schools will not provide you any form of relief. I've never met you before so I can't comment on what you can work on, but I do believe that if we want to improve the quality of the circles and friends that we're in, we need to first improve ourselves. Make a journal, reflect on your thoughts, read some personal development books.\n\nBased on your post, it sounds like you're looking at your situation with a victim mentality. \"I even started praying... I feel like I am at such a loss...\" Just a simple switch in your mindset can mean the world of a difference (i.e. \"I'm going through a tough time right now, but I know that this is just going to help me improve even more\"\n\nHope this wasn't offensive, that wasn't my intention! Good luck out there.",
            "Two things:\n\n1. They/we aren't. SO many of us are lonely all or most of the time. The pandemic intensified this trend but it was already being called the silent killer. \n2. The only \"answer\" is to love the shit out of yourself, do what brings you joy, and disconnect from the idea that you should be a fancy brand on IG. Be authentic and your realness and vulnerability will lead to authentic connections that can become way more secure friendships. If you can, try to see alone time as an opportunity to indulge in doing whatever you really like, without any judgement. Making things can help.",

            "befriend one very extroverted person and get introduced to all their friends",
            "If I’m being honest, most of the friends I’ve made so far consist of those who were in my labs/tutorials. Because a lot of these sections are group based, whoever you sit next to sort of becomes your new bestie for the term if you’re lucky. I met a lot of people like this in first year, and because I had their contact information from that class, I managed to strike up conversations with them again if I saw them in my future classes (in second, third, fourth year). I barely made friends from joining clubs because most of the people there already seem to be within a friendgroup, and it made it incredibly difficult to try and get into it without constantly feeling left out of the loop. \n\nGrab lunch with classmates this way! Eat together in the nest, or offer to study together in libraries. Try clubbing or going to bars together on Friday nights! I made a lot of friends this way and am really happy with my friend groups right now.",
            "Hey OP, sorry that you’re going through this. It sounds like you’re making a lot of good steps in the right direction. \n\nUnfortunately relationships and (platonic) attractions, who want to be your friends and who don’t, are really difficult to navigate. There are myriads of reasons why one may struggle to make friends. You need to figure out why you specifically are struggling to make friends, whether by introspection or therapy (especially when it’s affecting your mental health to the extent that you’re crying every other day). Personally, over the years I’ve spent a lot of time pinpointing and working on my issues when it comes making friends. I don’t think I’m done, but I’m far from the awkward kid with only 2 friends I was 10 years ago. Pretty sure there are more than 2 people out there in the world who care about and put in the effort for me. Working on yourself pays off.\n\nLastly, I feel like great compatible people don’t come into your life just because you want them to. It takes time. I didn’t meet one of my closest friends until my 4th year at UBC. I hope in time you’ll find your people too.",

If they are not total assholes they will try to repay you by offering to buy you a coffee or to dine together or something similiar. Now that you successfully managed to say hello, you would probably offer to buy them coffee back. This shall occur a number of times and before that you will be hanging out together.

            "hi! i transferred to UBC from a really competitive school in the states. arguably, a lot of people in my life thought i “downgraded”. so here’s some thoughts from a person who’s seen very different walks of college life\n1. UBC is a big school. That’s my favorite part, because i’m fairly outgoing and social but really struggled at my old school with feeling like I was stuck in a fishbowl. Going from ~7000 students to ~40,000 is a huge jump and it made me feel so much safer to be embarrassing and try new things knowing i would likely never see these people again. that’s how i learned i’m good at latin dance, i don’t like kickboxing much, and my calling is psychology. \n2. people at UBC are shy. my friends and i joke that it’s because canadian white/asian students and international asian students are “quiet cultures” that generally keep to themselves. that being said, the whole ‘vancouver is cold’ thing didn’t resonate with me. you just have to be more willing to initiate. \n3. profs are hit or miss and classes are GIGANTIC depending on your major. i’m in psych, which is especially large, so this was kind of a struggle for me. Because my old school was high ranking, most of my professors were incredible and classes were small. At UBC, you really do have to work to be known by your profs, and that’s been kind of hard for me\n\noverall, i’ve loved my time at UBC and haven’t regretted the transfer for a moment. but personality is a huge indicator of whether this school is an easy fit for you.",
            "the right decision for you may not be the right decision for someone else. all you can do is research as much as possible, come out for a campus tour, and if you don’t like it - you can transfer. that’s really about it, i really enjoyed my time but there are definitely people who didn’t 🤷🏼‍♀️",

            "True, it is quite competitive. You could have started applying though after 2 years at UBC. The program did change a few years back to decrease the amount of theory in the program, they’re about the same now as other programs. That said, a 3 or 4 year program at any of the colleges is far more book heavy because you aren’t entering into third year like in the UBC program. More credits to complete = more theory. Since all health authorities also have new grad programs now, any new grad will have the same skills at the end of their 6 months regardless of where they took their nursing degree. You’ll also have the same opportunities.",
            "Wow that sounds awesome. I guess the part I’m most worried about is whether or not I’ll be doing practicums while studying or not. I know for VCC they have practicums twice a week on top of all the courses they’re doing so they have a lot of solid references and experience working in those areas. I want to start working or doing practicums as soon as I start studying so I can build up my experience. Would you know anything about this ? Thanks for the info!!",
            "Most of the colleges follow the same format. UBC has two days of clinical per semester, they start 2-3 weeks into every term. You’ll get experience in older adults, mental health & primary health care, peds & maternity, and medical/surgery. Then the final term is preceptorship. \n\nYou can also gain experience doing employed student nursing (ESN) for specialized experience in your desired area.",
            "Wow this sounds extremely promising!! I’m definitely going to have a chat with my advisor this week! I think it’d be easier to just stay in UBC rather than transfer over to VCC. Thank you so much for the help ☺️"

The labs were alright though\n\nBIOL 352 (Plant hormone lab) was alright, but the lectures can get pretty long and a lot of the content is really easy to miss. The labs are super chill but there are quite a few papers to write.\n\nBIOL 341/340 I heard was a nightmare for a lot of people, but the actual lab technique is incredibly useful for “real” lab experience.",
            "I took BIOL 340 and 437 as my lab courses. BIOL 340 was tough and I remember hearing it was the worst of the lab courses, but I think part of the lab being difficult was that my group tried to do something more difficult than expected for our final project (other groups had it more straight-forward). I would lean towards not picking this one unless you had a specific goal in mind.\n\nBIOL 437 was an absolute blast though! It does have a pretty large block of time though and there are many pre-requisites, but the techniques learned were some of the most useful ones for my graduate degree and the grading isn't harsh provided you do the work. The prof who runs it (David Ng) is spectacular at what he does and he makes the course a lot of fun. I don't recall the lab being a huge time sink outside of the course block, but it likely doesn't fit with packed schedules. The class itself is a mix of undergrads and grad students too.",

",
        "comments": [
            "Usually it’s avoidable unless something like last year happens where some majors suddenly got pretty hard to get into (like MATH last year)\n\nFor instance, science lets you pick 3 choices. Suppose your grades are good, but iffy for CAPS, but that’s your top choice, and you’d be cool with MICB or BIOL. Then you pick CAPS as your first then MICB then BIOL. BIOL has basically more seats than students who want BIOL because they’re a massive department. So if don’t get CAPS, you can get MICB, and if you don’t get either CAPS or MICB, then you’d be in BIOL. You could do second year in BIOL and then try to switch to your desired specialization.\n\nLet’s think of another example. Say you don’t like anything but computer science, and your grades are borderline or impossible for CS this year. Then you’d pick something like CS first choice regardless (who knows, maybe something happened and there’s extra seats), and then another similar major that also doesn’t have many mandatory credits required to promote to 3rd year, and has overlap with your major. MATH/COGS/STAT is a good choice, and then you switch in 3rd year or 4th. If you don’t get in and your almost at 60 credits, you can apply to transfer to another university (most other schools will take at most 60 credits of 1xx/2xx level)\n\nThe bottom line is: always pick your most wanted major as your 1st, and 3rd choice should be something safe and something you’re comfortable with doing, or at least makes it easy for you to transfer to a major you want. You really don’t want to end up forced into 2nd year phys when really all you want is biochem.\n\nYou also pick your major in like June when your final grades are back so you can be strategic with your choices.\n\nIn arts, you apply to a competitive major, and you can self declare the rest. You’d just apply for your major and then self declare another backup if you don’t get in, and perhaps try to switch later or do a related path.",
            "You have two choices:\n1. Go through with the major you actually got into\n2. Switch majors the next year",
            "I was rejected from all of mine. I don’t really feel shame about it anymore. \n\nI was sent an email with specializations that still had space after everyone else was sorted. It was first-come, first-serve, and I was at work when I got the email. Got a pretty unfortunate specialization as the outcome (that I don’t care about at all.)\n\nThe hardest part is trying to progress in what you’re in, while completing courses for your desired specialization. (Honestly, I’m not sure if it’s worth switching at this point but that’s a long story).\n\nThe best thing I have going for me is being a TA, and I’m in talks with a PI about a summer thing at a UBC lab. I don’t know, things will probably work out, and I bet your grades are much better than mine were.",
            "I was rejected from all of my choices. After which they’ll allow you to send another 3 choices to specializations that still have room, which is a first come first serve basis. I didn’t have any courses that satisfied any of the requirements for the other majors other than Combined Major Science, so I was stuck in that major for my second year.\n\nMy plan was to apply for a transfer to the major I wanted as soon as applications opened and I assumed I would get in. So I continued to register for the courses required for that major, along with some GPA boosters. \n\nI did apply to SFU for the program I wanted as a backup plan, in case my transfer was rejected, which is something you should also keep in mind. A backup plan never hurts.",

            "UBC should drop their application fee to like $20-$50 and/or remove as many barriers as possible to apply. They'd get way more applications, thus artificially dropping the acceptance rate, boosting prestige. Northeastern is well known for using this strategy to great effect. For example, a couple years ago they went standardized testing optional which dropped their acceptance rate from 20% to 6% in just one year. They didn't have the housing to fit more people anyway but they just game the rankings this way. Now more people apply because they think its cooler, meaning more attention, more application fees, less money needed for marketing, higher rankings and more funding, more housing, lower tuition... UBC would have higher quality applications the next year when word spreads about their super low acceptance rate of 6% or whatever, eventually boosting actual research quality and rankings, making it all legit. Then they can tighten up or whatever they want to do. Idk that's just my thoughts.",

Full details are in the link above.\n\n---\n\n## Winners of 'Best of' 2023 (& 2022)\n\nYou can now find the winners of this year, as well as past years, on this page: https://ubcwiki.ca/meta/community/#best-of-awards\n\nA big congratulations to the following users!\n\n- u/AdAppropriate7838 for Best comment\n- u/whatisfoolycooly for Best text post\n- u/oui_oui-baguette for Best image or video post\n- u/toebin_ for Most wholesome post/comment\n- u/askaskaskaska and u/sevenelevenevan for Best meme\n\nSince we didn't properly announce the winners from 2022, another big (belated) congratulations to the following users:\n\n- u/TheHolyRatKing for Best comment\n- u/i-want-bbt- for Best text post\n- u/nonvideo for Best image or video post\n- u/AJazzy69 for Most wholesome post/comment\n- u/genuine-penguin for Best meme\n\nTo see all the posts at once and for links to the posts themselves, please see the link above.\n\n---\n\n## Study Spots guide\n\nThank you to u/chilylugia for putting this together!\n\nYou might remember seeing these study spot posts:\n\n> This might be my last year at UBC, so my partner encouraged me to study at every single building on campus! (since I’ve only pretty much studied at the biology building for the past few years LOOOL)\n> \n> I hope that this will also encourage y’all to check out different buildings for study spots as well!\n\nWith the help of u/chilylugia, we now have a page on study spots that you can refer people to:\n\nhttps://ubcwiki.ca/campus/study-spots/\n\nIf you have an idea for a section, or you want to fix something on the wiki, see how you can do so: https://ubcwiki.ca/#contributing\n\n---\n\n## Lost & Found guide\n\nWe get a lot of posts from people that either lost or found items on campus. We've compiled a guide on what to do in each situation, and what resources are available depending on where it happened. \n\nWe also set automod to comment this link when it detects a lost and found post. Hopefully, this will help people save valuable time when trying to get items back to their rightful owners.\n\nhttps://ubcwiki.ca/campus/lost-and-found/\n\nIf you see a lost and found post that automod misses, please link this page for them :)\n\n---\n\n## Rule Clarifications\n\nThere have been some complaints about posts with bad titles, where the actual question is buried in the body of the post. Moving forward, we will be more strict with our guidelines around post titles. \n\nWhen asking a question or making a post, please write out the full question in the title field. You can still clarify in the body of the post. \n\nGood:\n\n> **Does anyone know what's happening at the Nest right now?**\n> \n> [body of the post]\n\n.\n\nBad:\n\n> **question...**\n> \n> [body of the post]\n\n.\n\n> **The Nest**\n> \n> [body of the post]\n\n.\n\n> **What's happening??**\n> \n> [body of the post]\n\n.\n\nWe have other rule clarifications, but we will share those later on.\n\n---\n\n## What happened to the icon?\n\nFirst of all, this icon is not permanent! We would love to change it to something else made by the community. Consider this icon a temporary placeholder while a better icon is created.\n\nA little over a year ago, we removed our old Snoo icon and [held a contest for a new one](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/zdbq8o/calling_all_artists_of_rubc_contest_for_a_new/). Unfortunately, the timing of the post was likely bad because we only got two submissions, of which one did not actually want their submission to be used, and the other ended up deleting their submission. \n\nSince we've needed a icon for a while, and since we needed something for the new wiki site and Lemmy community, we threw together a very simple placeholder. While preparing all the other stuff above, I thought that I could change out the icon while updating the links in the sidebar, instead of waiting to make this post. Instead, I accidentally put the Lemmy icon onto both the subreddit and the lemmy community, instead of the correct ones for both. Whoops.\n\nRegardless, please consider this an open invitation to create new art for the icons! When we have time, we will either hold a poll or make a formal contest again for the new icon. Thank you to u/MeltedChocolate24 and u/UmbreonMoonshadow for already offering to make a new icon! Since we want to give everyone a chance to submit and weigh in on what the icon should look like, we aren't making any selections right away. \n\n---\n\nAs always, we love your thoughts and contributions. If you have an idea for the wiki, or want to fix something, see this page for the different ways that you can contribute: https://ubcwiki.ca/#contributing\n\nHope you have a good rest of the reading break, and take care!",

The investigation probably didn’t result in anything aside from maybe a talk from the department to be careful about language. \n\nAnd no, it’s not temporary. He will be teaching 233 if nothing of note occurs.",

            "He will be teaching",
            "Do decent, rely on others to spend more time complaining then studying, then get scaled to the moon. This is what my friends and I all did in W2022 to get 98s and 99s.",
            "Should I not take it this summer then 😭",
            "He’s… to put it bluntly, not very good at teaching",
            "From personal experience, his exams tend to include material that’s quite complicated/may not align with the rate of material taught by other professors in the same course. It was a surprise for students in the winter who took the midterms as it’s believed he wrote the exams, meaning some questions may not have been what people were expecting for the first/second midterm /final. He likes to go over problems in class in detail rather than lecturing on the material in depth if that’s your speed. I had to look at the material from other professors teaching the course to keep up in class. During winter, each week had a quiz as well",
            "I took Chem 233 with professor Sherman and to be fair his notes are actually reasonably good. If you come to class with difficult questions or go to office hours, he usually gives you a pretty good answer. The exams are reasonably hard and do require quite a bit of thinking which is difficult to do during midterms. However, there is a group portion of the exam which I think makes up 10% of each exam mark? So find a good group. Overall while there was a lot of piazza drama, complaining and open letters being written to the chemistry department, it was still manageable to say the least.",
            "he's horrible at teaching. sucks. he treats it like everyone is in a phd program and there to fundamentally understand the topics, when most of us are there because we don't have a choice and we just want to understand how these freaking reactions work when they appear in exam questions. I ended up being bored to death in his lectures and eventually just showing up to another section taught by a different instructor.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I did it over the summer last year and honestly, I did go to class for the first quiz of four and that ended up being my worst grade. I straight up stopped going to the lectures and I doubled down on the textbook and the lecture notes. They'd uploaded Jay's old lectures too so I just watched those. Studied at home. Ended with a decent grade.",
            "I would say if you have a strong chemistry base (I didn’t really, haha), it should be doable but I wouldn’t really recommend it, unless you work well with that style of teaching. I actually took chem 233 twice, once in the winter with Prof. Sherman and then in the summer with the lab with another professor and still found that the summer was more informative. I felt that the lecture-heavy style worked best with organic chem if you’re not familiar with it.",
            "Definitely agree with this; I was in Sherman's section for a bit before I got switched to Jay's section so I've also seen both styles; Sherman goes through practice problems a lot (without slides and thus without much structure). \n\nI also agree that his exam questions are (subjectively) harder; on exams, I could tell which questions he wrote. They tended to be more convoluted than normal.\n\nI would advise trying to avoid him if possible, but from what I understand he's teaching a lot of 233 sections these days? unfortunate.",
            "To give some further info: the classes winter term average w him was an overall 64, while the summer one I took (different professor with lecture-heavy style) was 71."

I haven’t been able to find a job and have basically given up on that. \nI was wondering if there is a way to help individuals and connect with people in my neighbourhood by volunteering my time to lend them a hand? I’d take out trash, walk their pets, clean, or garden without a price attached but maybe just tips since I mostly want to do community work ❤️ \nThe weather has me quite down and although I’m on top of my physical health, running and getting strong can’t take up all my time. I really miss helping others and contributing to a community it almost makes me sad. \nI got on the app nextdoor and was wondering if there are more ways or popular methods to help others (aside from volunteering establishments). I thought about putting up flyers in my neighbourhood or looking at FB groups but if anyone has a lead let me know!! \n\nThank u! 😭😭",

            "\\> I haven’t been able to find a job and have basically given up on that.

Sorry it sounds rude, but you only volunteer after you know you can support yourself first, especially in this economy.",
            "I’m kind of in a weird point of time because finding a job right now feels rather unethical since I will be starting my seasonal work within 2 months. It’s really hard finding a temporary job that would only have you for these 2 months, especially considering I’ve already been job hunting for the last 3 months with no luck. I’m able to survive still with my saved money but it’s not pretty. Much rather do this than get a job where I’m gonna have to lie and then dip immediately… that seems just so shitty. 🥲\nI’d rather invest in my happiness and general well-being until then by helping the community and trying to spread goodness.",
            "ok, i see, that's understandable if you have enough in savings.\n\nI know there is the Greater Vancouver Food Bank where you can volunteer either as a group or even individually if it interests you."

As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.\n\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.\n\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\n\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\n\nExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.\n\nBe yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.\n\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\n\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\n\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.\n\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.\n\nby Max Ehrmann ©1927",

Do you have a good therapist? Those venues might help make this term a bit more bearable.\n\nI'm in a similar situation tbh. I'm telling myself I just have to grind for 2 months and then I'll be free (I say, pretending I won't be taking summer classes). Would it be doable to go through the rest of this term week by week or even day by day, class by class? Just going to class might help, even if all you do is sit there and stare at the prof. Human interaction can bolster your mood and you might find a study buddy to get some assignments done.\n\nBeing on reading break is to your advantage here. You could take this week to completely unplug from school, take some walks in the sunny weather, basically do your best to forget school for a week and refresh yourself. That might give you enough of a boost to get through the rest of the term.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, this advice might be hard to put into action.

Principled design of correct, performant and robust algorithms or software systems both requires and exercises critical thinking skills to a very high degree.\n\nThat said, the level at which analysis occurs is often too low/concrete to be considered “meta”. This is just the nature of science courses in my view. The goal is to impart a certain set of fairly concrete knowledge that isn’t necessarily at the “meta” level. I’ve taken a bunch of philosophy electives which I feel are a better avenue for pursing that sort of thing. I don’t see it as the Faculty of Science’s responsibility to ensure I spend time at concrete and meta levels. Rather it’s mine as a student with the choices I make for electives.",
            "Hey! My friend I have talked about similar things and we had very different views. I always wonder: why do people expect to be led through the critical thinking processes in class? In my opinion, after you get enough basic knowledge(which are the information you need to know before starting to debate over it)you can brainstorm yourself right? When I take classes, what I expect is to get information and information sources. What I actually always didn’t like is when some teachers fill the class with debate and discussions. I feel that what we should get from the course is the basic start point knowledge; As for how one want to make use of this information, what new things you can create from it, what it can mean to the whole human etc, there are endless possibilities and therese are the things each person think of on their own. It’s like when I’m given a box of crayons, I just want to learn about basic ways of using crayons; I can use it in more creative ways, but I just think of ways on my own. What’s there to be taught about? Creative really means you need to use your own idea right?",

If you instead were in a forum specifically dedicated to the topic with industry folks as the baseline, students would have far more to learn. \n\nFor example, had some great discussions about AI hardware yesterday with folks from Nvidia and amd.

To provide insight into how they will respond and adapt. \n\nSo instead of talking about OSI in a Java course (or whatever), I have a different metaphor. We are sitting in a burning classroom.

This includes socially and intellectually, with many political movements stemming from university students. \n\nPhotos of university students protesting segregation and the Vietnam war are sources of pride for many people (thankfully we still have the UBC communist party /s). I just don’t see that kind of thing happening in universities today. There’s a multitude of reasons (university as a way to a job, the explosion of university population, the expansion of access to university, universities as a business) that this happened but it’s definitely left a poor legacy. \n\nI think the upper graduate programs are more suited for the “true” university experience and learning environment. Every PhD student I’ve met has been plugged into events, research and development surrounding their field, more than any undergraduate or masters student. They are also much more willing to address modern issues and discuss them in the context of their field. \n\nI guess this is what the commodification of undergraduate degrees has done to education.

Yes we don’t spend a lot of time debating the ethics of net neutrality or other political topics, but there are other majors for that.  Only so much time in a four year degree.\n\nThe second point is on ai automating software jobs and making computer science degrees useless, which feels like the point you’re actually trying to make.

            "Any new technology affects society, and AI will affect education -- but AI isn't the reason education as an industry is in long-term trouble.\n\nPhysics professors don't mind the students use calculators rather then do arithmetic by hand.  Similarly, outside classes where raw skill at writing is the focus, I expect using AI to assist the writing (whether prose or code) to become an expected tool -- with quality expectations rising accordingly.  You don't get accomodation in physics exams for doong arithmetic by hand after all.\n\nIf students are using AI to write their essays then we can't test writing skill or subject learning purely using essays, but that's about it.  I expect oral exams to make a comeback.  It's even possible to do a hybrid model where after students submit their essay they get asked questions about it by an examiner.  It's hard to answer questions like \"why did you choose this phrase?\" or \"why did you choose to hedge here?\" if you didn't write the essay yourself.  CS is already doing similar things with code submissions.\n\nA human augmented by AI can do more, so that ultimately will have to be the performance standard.  If we specifically want to teach skills replicated by the AI we'll have to use workarounds, but that's about it (for a current example, calculators are banned from calculus exams).",
            "TL;DR I’m concerned about how AI will play into the existing issues of increasing leniency in our education and reducing standards of knowledge needed to advance through the years of education. \n\nI prefer not to use AI. I value original thinking and learning how to do basic things, such as communicate effectively via writing, use proper grammar (always a work in progress!), and develop tone in my work. I don’t want a computer to decide for me what good sources are, I want to evaluate the integrity of a source and decide for myself whether it is trusted or not. \n\nAs a TA, I’m concerned about the students coming in who have already begun to rely on AI as a crutch. I’m seeing students who somehow wrote a personal profile well enough to be admitted to UBC, yet who cannot write a lab report / assignment / etc well enough for me to understand what they’re trying to say. Their thoughts are disconnected, their grammar and spelling abilities are non-existent (and several of them are native English speakers, I would not have quite the same qualms about English with individuals in Vantage programs in first year), they struggle to form original ideas, and frankly I’m astounded at how little effort is apparent in what they submit. \n\nI’m concerned about students in high school missing out on core concepts and skills (effective communication, citation, how to find trusted sources, simple math and language) because AI is so easily accessible that they begin to ask “why not”. \n\nBut I recognize mine will likely be an unpopular opinion because I’m also of the opinion that not everyone should pass every course, that more and more frequently people complain that it’s ridiculous that a course is so hard (obviously this does not include times when the professor is the problem or exams are truly ridiculous), when in reality there is a level of understanding that they are not meeting. Would you want your engineers to have gotten 51% in all their courses? I feel like we are trying to make it easier and easier for students to scrape by and sacrificing our standard of education in exchange.\n\nThis problem starts in high school though (I’m only familiar with Canadian curriculums so forgive me if this does not apply to international schools). I’m seeing students come into first year with fundamentals completely missing. Students in first year calculus who struggle with algebra. Students who don’t know what citations are or how to appropriately use them. Students who used AP credits to skip first year courses but then struggle in second year courses because AP courses don’t cover all the details needed. Students who are practically illiterate compared to where they should be in first year. It’s really not a failure on the students’ part (I see how hard they try), it’s a failure on secondary schools. \n\nAnyways, I’ve never been good at being concise. Should’ve learned that in high school. I’m worried AI is going to exacerbate the problems we’ve already been seeing in getting more and more lenient with our standard of education, encouraging this mindset of “but I should always be able to pass! It’s their fault I didn’t!”, and moving away from learning fundamental skills.\n\nOh and before someone jumps on me for “why should I have to write all my emails and cover letters”, I don’t have a problem with *you*, someone who already has learned how to write said things, using it to save time. I have a problem with people who have not yet fully learned how to do things, using AI too early, and then never properly learning how to do it themselves. It might not seem important to you that someone can write a cover letter on their own, but the skills they learn in learning how to write those things translate to skills for many other applications indirectly. They’re losing out on forming important literary and problem solving abilities.\n\nAnyways, I’ll stop talking now. Sorry for the ramble, this has just been on my mind a lot lately.\n\n(Disclaimer: I am a TA and have been for several years, but my views are not attached to UBC or any of its departments, they are my own)",
            "I mean AI is like Pandora's Box, once it's been opened there's not much we can do to stop it. I think education in general probably has to pivot around it, because, like it or not, AI will be an integral part of the future going forward, much like the internet. Our current education system is decades old and is just now catching up to the existence of the internet, so it will be a while until they can pivot around AI. I can see one of two things happening. One: education pivots and finds a system where they accept the existence of AI and try to develop curriculums around it or that complement it or two: they go completely against AI and do like 70 or 80 percent final exams on paper in-person.   \n\n\nIn terms of the ethical aspects of it, I like to think of AI as a tool, like a calculator sort of. It is a crutch or a time saver, just another way to help us do things easier or faster. Obviously, you shouldn't use AI for essays or stuff, but I think if I am applying for jobs with cover letters or need help writing important emails. It saves me plenty of time doing that, instead of me writing those myself. Might not take long, but those 5-10 mins add up when you're applying to hundreds of places. It's not like someone at HR is writing me personalized rejection emails either, so it's evening the odds. In the end, it's a tool, you can choose to use it however you want and most people will use it to write essays, but I am sure UBC and other schools are working on a response to this.",
            "I'm sessional faculty, currently teaching one section of a course that includes two essays. I didn't design the course but I'm a big fan of how it was designed. There is a whole bunch of mandatory prep work (annotated bibliography, rough draft, peer review, etc) that has to be submitted over the course of several weeks before the final essay is due.\n\nThis process-checking provides very effective control over the use of AI, while also just being good pedagogy. It lets me see how students are learning to write essays and gives me several structured opportunities to provide feedback on their search for sources, their development and revision of their essay's scope and thesis, etc. I've seen a few ChatGPT-looking paragraphs in the early process work (this is explicitly permitted for the early prep stages in this course), and they have just resulted in teachable moments.\n\nAll of that process work is an essential part of the kind of writing that higher ed is really for. Writing an essay (or a scholarly article for publication, or a legal brief, or a work of investigative journalism, or any other serious piece of writing supported by sources) has much more to do with careful, responsible engagement with sources than with putting sentences and paragraphs together. Crafting prose isn't unimportant, but it's not the main learning objective.\n\nAcademic writing in English, in the Anglosphere, is also a specific language variety, used in a range of specific genres, with serious, subtle variations between disciplines. (Fantastic work has been done on this at UBC! See e.g. the work of Janet Giltrow and her colleagues. CWSC, [https://writing.library.ubc.ca/](https://writing.library.ubc.ca/), is another great place to start.) Today's LLM output is often easy to identify in student submissions because, given the prompts that non-experts tend to provide, it does not nail these linguistic variations, but does produce normal-looking text with solid paragraph structure. That's not how student writing looks. Students mature in their academic writing in the context of an academic discipline, so when they have not yet mastered the nuanced conventions of that discipline, their writing generally also has weird, hard-to-understand quirks, of the kind that LLMs are good at avoiding.\n\nThe upshot is that I am not that worried about LLMs in higher ed. Maybe some LLM-generated written work successfully passes through the assessment workflow in courses with overworked instructors and TAs, but to the extent that this is happening at scale, I think it's just an indication that instructors and TAs have too many students and too little time for their workflow to result in particularly meaningful assessment anyway. To the extent that that's the case, the problem that needs solving is not fundamentally a pedagogy or academic honesty problem.",

That second crowd has always found ways to cheat whether it's just plagiarising stuff in essays, sneaking notes in class, getting a friend or family member or tutor to do their work (source: I was one of those kids). The issue with ai isn't that it's going to fundamentally change education, it's just going to exacerbate the laziness of already lazy and unmotivated students, so as educators we've really got to find a way to get these kids motivated and actually doing their work beyond just telling them \"ai bad do your work\"",

So many people think that information is just something that exists in some pure, ethereal form that is separate from the people and processes that generated it and that's just absolutely not the case. \n\nEven in just basic troubleshooting for software issues I still think googling the error message to find stackoverflow questions from people with similar problems - which tbh is where all the training data for chatgpt's cs programming knowledge came from - is a much better approach than querying chatgpt because being able to look at the original question is actually extremely helpful and gives you the context to make a decision about whether the answer is actually applicable to your circumstances or if your problem has assumptions/conditions that would make applying the proposed solution to your problem a really bad idea.   \n\nWe aren't making students write all these essays because anyone actually wants to read the student essays; we're making them write the essays because we don't want to live on a planet surrounded by people who can't form or understand a basic argument.",

Reference number (026.24.02.05.FZ.AL)\n\nProject description:\n\nAs young adults transition to post-secondary education and increased independence, dietary choices become a significant concern. Many students opt for dining out, with a substantial portion of their diet consisting of fast food and external sources. Given the time constraints imposed by commuting, there is a possibility that longer commutes may lead to change in the eating habits. **This study aims to investigate relationship between longer commutes and dietary habits.**\n\nParticipant data and privacy:\n\nThis survey is anonymous and NO identifying information will be collected (names, addresses, student number, medical information, etc.). Data collected will be downloaded from Qualtrics forms and stored in a password protected local hard drive. Following download, all data from Qualtrics will be deleted. Data will be stored for the duration of the project (estimated time: 4 months). Only the principal investigator and co-researchers will have access to data.\n\nAll this information and more can be found on the first page of the survey.\n\nThis survey should not take more than 5 minutes. Thank you in advance.\n\n[*https://qualtricsxmqxznmnpnx.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cMWMAQwtepVmycC*](https://qualtricsxmqxznmnpnx.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cMWMAQwtepVmycC)",

        "selftext": "Hello. I'm a 3rd year student living in a house share with 6 other UBC student.\n The house is being leased by the primary tenant and we pay the rent to her.\n\nWe were all living at peace for over 4 months until...\nIn January as a result of desperation after a roommate suddenly left they replaced her with a new girl. She didn't even pay the rent or signed the contract until a month later.\n\n4 days after she moved in, one morning she asked one of the roommates if anyone had money in the house. On the evening of the same day people's cash, credit cards, groceries, and cosmetics were missing. She was gone.\n\nAfter people figured what happend they entered her room to find all the missing stuff in there. There were also pizza and weed boxes matching the ones purchased with the missing credit cards. When we talked about calling the police there was a threatening scary anonymous messgee sent that night. However, I belive a police report was field. \n\nThe main roommate is afraid of not being abel to replace her (make it make sense) if she asks her to leave.\n\nShe denied taking the cards/money and said she accidentally took all the groceries and other stuff (yes belive it or not) \nSo they let her stay (partly it's because no one wanted her to be expelled or deported for petty theft)\nFor the next few weeks we all told her she could ask us if she needed something. We gave her stuff and tried to be kind. (It's student life and according to her mother she has bipolar disorder. We tried to be understanding.)\n\nShe is partying almost every night and is a heavy smooker. She allegedly doesn't even have a card yet somehow buys tons of new shoes and clothes and cosmetics very often. \n\nBut a couple weeks later things continued to go missing. One night when we were on campus and I was trying to pay for my stuff at the Gage market she told me I could just take it and that's what she always does. Obviously I didn't do it but was shocked at somone acting like this like it was nothing. I have the exact time and date.\n\nShe takes people's stuff then claims it's hers or she also lost something exactly like that.\n\nUnfortunately she also made close friends with one of the girls who has self-esteem issues and is too young.\n\n6 days ago I noticed my ipad is missing (and for the past week she kept telling me about her needing an iPad cause hers is broken.)\n\nI got angry and demanded all my stuff back. After days of texting,  she gave me the little stuff but not the money or the iPad.\n\nI called the police this time myself, they came but couldn't find any evidence in her room. I asked the roommates to show them photos of what was found in her room previously but they are rightly scared of getting in trouble (all international students.)\nDoesn't help that her friend went on to her defense and denied her stuff getting stolen.\n\nPolice said there's nothing that can be done without evidence and asked me not to \"escalate\" the situation! \"We have more important stuff than to deal with you kids.\"\n\nAfter police left she started laughing loudly and told me I'm gonna \"regret this.\"\n\nShe is completely unhinged and I'm scared to death. My stuff are being taken, we're all struggling students and I don't have anyone here to support me.\n\nCan someone please suggest me something?\n\n\n\n",

She denied it and people got their stuff back (with the expectation of the money in credit cards which was disputed.) \nThis time , my ipad, money, and the food I paid for are all gone and nobody is being held responsible.

I'm working on it T_T\nThe only issue is that if I leave here before the end of the contract I'll lose my deposit and atm I don't have enough money to pay for the deposit elsewhere (at least not until school is over when I can work more.) I'm still searching though. You're right, the ultimate and safest solution is moving out and this is a great time for it. \nAlso in no way I don't mean to say everyone with a mental health issue is dangerous (I myself struggle with depression) but we know she was hospitalized and diagnosed with BPD. Over the last month we've heard some weird stuff happening with her (things like lying about her dad being dead or being pregnant etc.) This is also why I'm so worried for my safety. I desperately tried ro get the police involved, they can't do anything without a solid proof (like a video of her stealing or photos (which we actually have but the roommate who has it is hesitant to show it to the police.)

However, developments in AI are frighteningly fast. The common phrase we used to hear is that \"AI is just a tool so you don't have to worry\". Yeah, that argument seemed to hold until companies were laying off tens of thousands of tech workers despite posting record earnings, and directly quoting \"AI investments\" as the reason for layoffs, and until Open AI's Sora began to produce 3D graphics that are rivaling VFX studios working on B-roll productions. All of this happened in just one year. Go visit [r/VFX](https://www.reddit.com/r/VFX/) Reddit and watch how the narratives changed in just a few months. People who have tens of years of work experience are scared shitless.\n\nWhen AI comes up, people start talking about whether their jobs are replaceable or not. The real issue is that AI is shifting the narratives in our industry, from \"a growing number of employees means higher company valuation and promising future\" to \"a growing business integrates AI into their workflow and prevents unnecessary, reckless hiring schemes\". We're already in competition to the bottom, and the ultimate goal is to enable a handful of execs to run an entire global corporation. Snapchat never needed 8000 workers across the globe to work on that app. They never needed tens of UI/UX developers to work on some small aspect of the design and call it a day. They needed the numbers to show their investors that they were a growing business. That \"brick and mortar\" narrative of evaluating a company's performance is now shifting because of AI, and it will impact every industry.\n\nThis is unlike the first Industrial Revolution where we developed engines that mimic the power of our muscles. This time we are mimicking human logic and consciousness in our machines: Now, not every admin assistant or HR personnel can be trained to become a manager. Not every data analyst and software developer can become a product manager and an AI researcher, like how not every graphics artist can be trained to become a creative director. The IMF warns that entire sectors of the economy will need to be re-trained. If we are re-trained, how much longer until we need to be re-trained again? Into what?\n\nMight be an unpopular opinion, but this is a great time to re-evaluate what we want to do with our jobs. If it's a specific \"brick and mortar\" job title that we're going for, like what our parents are used to, it might be best to think ahead and consider how it will evolve or simply disappear into the workflow of an existing managerial position with the assistance of AI.",

I'm sure this will be mitigated over time but it will never be 100% and oftentimes it has problems precisely because the people in charge utilize them poorly.\n\nFinally, lots of jobs in academia, the trades, arts, etc are difficult to replace with AI and those jobs are likely to be pretty well insulated for a while, as lots of them require creativity and inspiration that AI still lacks and may always be lacking.",

There's a classic paper on the field that gave us the phrase \"stochastic parrot\" which I strongly, strongly, urge anyone who is worried about this stuff to read as a first step because it gives a great framework to think through what is actually happening when you plug something into chatgpt: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922",

They don't need 8000 workers.\n\nAnd with the change in the investment narrative to AI, I bet you they will be laying off thousands more in the next couple of years or even months like Google laying off thousands and quoting their decision to invest in AI, instead.\n\nWe are past the stage where you can remain in denial.",

I don't think GPT and the human brain do qualitatively different things, but their quantitative performance is very different. One of the key weaknesses of the current generation of AI tools is a poor ability to generalize. A human who performs very well on Codeforces 2022 will do well at Codeforces 2023. Meanwhile, GPT-4 crushed 2022 and did very poorly at 2023. One of the key weaknesses in a programming capacity is the ability of LLMs to integrate the \"knowledge\" they have into unfamiliar scenarios-you can't just turn an LLM loose into a github repo and expect it to perform properly. LLMs are very good at coding, but can't yet do it reliably without the presence of a human dev. This MAY change at some point, but I see no reason to believe it is inevitable.\n\nI think my opinion, when it comes down to it, is that an LLM or GPT is a machine where you insert a prompt, and it provides a best-effort fulfillment of that prompt which is often really good, but is also often either totally wrong or flawed in some significant way. I think that LLMs will be a big part of how we work going forward, but I don't think there are many jobs that are both incredibly economically productive, and also tolerate enough error that they can be done fully by AI rather than with an AI-human collaboration.",

There are several bottlenecks that may stall development. Each GPT generation has needed exponentially more money, compute, high-quality training data and power than the previous, and it's unclear if even Microsoft can scale up to meet those needs, especially if GPT-5 or 6 don't wow them enough to invest like 100 billion dollars in the next generation. And we may already be nearly out of training data!",
            "Making thousands of dollars in AI software for the government is not particularly impressive, I'm sorry to say. Everyone is just absolutely throwing money at AI right now. I'm happy for you, but it certainly does not follow from that that you \"know their limits very well\".",
            "Three things: \n\n1\\. Visual processing and other forms of perceptual processing can be very different, fundamentally so, from other forms of cognition, particularly where reasoning is implicated. They are processed in different parts of the brain and the processes themselves have some distinct differences. So as evidence for your original claim, this is insufficient.\n\nEDIT: The *only* article which is actually relevant is the third one you linked. Putting aside that you've linked an overly simplified blog post, let's talk about the research itself. The claims made in the paper are not groundbreaking to anyone who is actually familiar with neuroscience or cognitive science, since we know that language comprehension is, like visual processing, is mediated (or \"modulated\", to use the term from the paper) by predictive processes. But then you can read my response below. Comprehension of other speakers being predictive in nature does not respond to the AI debate itself; you are equivocating in using \"prediction\" in two different senses.\n\n2\\. \"Involving predictive coding mechanisms\" does not demonstrate that the brain is something that merely does predictive coding. The operation of neural nets involves backpropagation, but that is not merely all that they are. One thing that neuroscience teaches us is that human cognition is mediated through both top-down and bottom-up processes. To the extent that backpropagation might attempt to mimic this, I'm not convinced that it has been able to do so to the same extent. So again, this is insufficient as a defence or proof of your claim. Normally, I'd be inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt here; after all, you said that the brain is a predictive machine, not that it is \"merely\" or \"only\" a predictive machine. But given the context in which you made your claim, i.e. in response to someone saying that LLMs are not particularly robust yet given that they are essentially just predictive models, one assumes that you meant to say something along the lines of \"Sure, but even if that is true, that is no reason to suggest that they are not impressive. *Our brains are no different* (that is, they are also *just* predictive models), so if LLMs are not impressive neither are our brains!\" \n\nContrast that with the claim \"Part of our cognitive processes is that we sometimes use predictive coding.\" If this is what you meant instead, then again it doesn't really prove your point. AI skeptics just have to say that our brains do a lot more than just that, and so you can't really defend LLMs on that basis alone. And indeed the skeptic has a lot of material to use here, since the predictive coding elements of our perceptual and rational processing is often the cause of us making errors. In visual perception, this is emphasized by the adage \"you see what you want to see\", and not necessarily what is actually there, i.e. visual illusions. In reasoning, you might consider that our heuristics and mental shortcuts often lead to failures of rationality when we fall prey to fallacies and illusory modes of reasoning. So there are quite a few reasons to think that prediction is not a particularly helpful way of thinking, but thankfully we do have good reasons to think that human reasoning goes far beyond just prediction. \n\n3\\. \"When we talk and write we ARE doing next-token prediction\". This claim you make in your earlier comment completely ignores the fact that human cognition is mediated through higher-order structures that organize and collect our ideas. Even now, as I write a comment in response to your claims, I'm not simply predicting what word best follows from the ones before, but rather finding the words that best express the higher-order thought that I want to communicate. Now, to the extent that LLMs have demonstrated structure in the writing that they produce, there is still a significant difference in the way in which they produce that structure. The point that skeptics make is that LLMs do not work off of a higher-level cognitive process in the first place--for now, LLMs lack that element. On this particular point, I'm sure you'd benefit from speaking to people in either neuroscience or linguistics. The goal of humans speaking to one another, and the way in which they do so, is different from an LLM interlocutor engaging with a human.\n\nIf you look more closely at the second article you've linked (not the pop sci article but the actual research it references), you should find that there is a pretty drastic difference in what they are reporting versus what we're talking about here. The internal probabilities they reference have nothing to do with the kind of prediction we are talking about when we talk about speech or LLMs. The core claim is about whether speech is linked to higher-order thoughts and ideas or whether it follows from mere prediction based on what came before, not about our estimation of probabilities of failure/success or of making correct choices in that estimation. \n\nPlease don't try and explain fields that you clearly are unfamiliar with.",

I would hate to have to be constantly worried about every movement I make in fear of upsetting whoever is below me.\n\nNormally I would have no problem with someone asking me to keep it down if I was being loud but it was so sudden and the yelling, finger shaking, cutting me off every time I tried to speak really put me on edge..",

I’m not familiar with MD1 but in a lot of buildings, it’s crazy sometimes what can cause major noise transfer to lower units and a little bit of curtesy can go along way. \n\nBTW, you can get felt pads for furniture for a couple dollars and give the extras to your upstairs neighbour to benefit yourself as well. :)",

Whereas at UBC many first year classes are weeder classes, at SFU those transfer students said they could actually learn and the quality of instruction was generally quite decent.\n\nI have very little respect for UBC as an institution. Sure there are many amazing professors here, and many great people, but the institution as a whole is very messed up.

Electromagnetism is the you first see the true majesty of the subject’s theoretical weight meet experimental precision to result in the biggest practical technological leaps for humanity. I might be over-exaggerating, but it’s pretty special.\n\nThe joke about the thermodynamics is the first one you learn it, you don’t understand it. The second time you learn it, you think you understand it. The third time you learn it, you are sure you don’t understand it. 203 is the first step in a long cycle of not understanding and understanding.",

            "A new prof took over the course 2 years ago and made it even more condensed. It might just be the nature of optics if it was brutal under whichever prof teaches it.\n\nI actually thought the labs were really interesting for the one I completed (and read through the rest). But they aren't synced with the course material. So I had to do additional reading for the last unit of the course in week 1. The actual data collection seemed fine for that one once my partner and I figured it out. It was just a lot of figuring it out.\n\nYou get to play with a laser table, so I would consider it worth it if you're really confident with your math skills. I consider it the most difficult PHYS course, but still a really good one if you're prepared for it.",
            "Hey!! Just saw your comment now ~ congrats on your admission!! The other user is correct that arts CPSC is harder to get into. Definitely at minimum you need to have an 85 average for domestic (though there are rare cases of people getting in *slightly* below that). In my year, there were only 30-40 seats in the program (from what I heard). \n\nIt’s definitely doable though!! If you want any other advice or anything from an upper year arts cs person feel free to dm me! :)"

But how it really should be is doing something fun together and then maybe becoming friends. After all if you don't participate in doing something together how will you know if you like each other as people or not? So I would say don't worry too much about it and focus on being present in the activity. And maybe even express enthusiasm for being there!

And why so much more seats than literal entire faculties? Like why would UBC SPHR get seats but not another national group on campus that is also facing colonization? Or why would UBC Transco get seats but not, say, UBC Pride Collective? \n\nAnd that’s only on some seats, because for example “Indigenous Students” or the Black Student Union as groups represent a bigger “diversity” of backgrounds and right revendication scopes than UBC SPHR, which represents, well, Palestinian rights.\n\nAnd more so, why would these groups not be penalized by any sanctions of the AMS, essentially protecting them more than other members? The petition mentions “minority stress” - so would the representatives from faculties that are from the same minorities also be exempt from repercussions?\n\nAlso, what do we think of ending Hillel’s lease? Should we also advocate for ending Chabad’s lease, which is even less “liberal” (from a Jewish perspective) than Hillel? \n\nI’m not looking to get or to foster any hate please, just genuinely trying to understand different points of view! :)",

This could poison any good work they try to do for years to come.\n\nThat’s not even mentioning how bad the instantaneous RBC divestment, or banning all constituency members from using Roberts Rules would be.\n\nEDIT: to clarify, the RBC divestment was part of the petition focusing on Palestine, which has already met the signature threshold.

            "I'm glad you brought this up, because I also have some concerns and things I don't understand about the proposal:\n\n\\- Why have completely separate categories of council members instead of advocating for adding diversity-restricted seats to faculty constituencies?\n\n\\- Seconding your concern, **who decides which marginalization is \"enough\" to merit seats on council?**\n\n\\- If seats for other student groups are added in the future, will they be taken from the pool of the currently approved number of student group seats, or will more seats be added and affect the distribution between AMS VPs/faculties/student groups?\n\n\\- Why does the SJC as a group get voting members on council? Considering that anyone can join the SJC and that their aims are very broad, what perspective or expertise do they provide that general students don't?\n\n\\- Why remove percentage of voting members as a requirement for a quorum?\n\n\\- A concern I have is with the process of deciding who will occupy the council seats within these groups. For example, I'm a woman but I don't even know where I'd begin with having my voice heard by UBC Women's Centre. How will those on council for the Women's Centre and Trans Coalition ensure that they speak for those who aren't part of their group?\n\n\\- I think I might be misunderstanding this, but aren't there only around 20-30 voting members from all faculties on council currently? Why so many more student group seats? Wouldn't this make it possible for motions to pass without elected support from the vast majority of student body?\n\nIn the past I've also noticed some pressure to sign/vote for things without voicing any concerns in the name of solidarity (such as the \"vote yes\" thing last year instead of saying the merits of individual proposals), imo lack of ability to discuss and criticize is more concerning from a social justice perspective. Anyway, I would really appreciate any responses or explanations for these things!",

            "Expelling Hillel and Chabad from the campus? I cannot believe what I am reading.\n\nIt is both shameful and utterly absurd. Those of you who work to promote \"diversity\" and \"inclusion\" are doing everything in your power to expel organizations simply because they are Jewish (yes, there is no use in denying or pretending it is not antisemitism).\n\nThis proposal to terminate leases for organizations that are foundational to the Jewish student community is not only a grave misstep but also a dire misrepresentation of what these groups stand for. Hillel and Chabad provide critical support systems, educational resources, and a sense of belonging, all while fostering the free practice of religion and culture. Their presence is not a political statement but a testament to the inclusive values that educational institutions are meant to embody.\n\nEquating these organizations with the actions of a foreign government conflates disparate entities and unjustly targets students based on their faith. It also dangerously ignores the principle of individual freedom, casting a shadow of collective guilt over an entire community for the actions of a separate sovereign state.\n\nFurthermore, being \"less liberal\" is not a justification for anything. No one is obliged to think the same as you, and by suggesting such exclusions, you demonstrate just how undemocratic and opposed to individual freedom you are.\n\nThis is nothing but despicable antisemitism, especially egregious in the wake of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, where it is all the more important to uphold principles of tolerance and support for all students on campus.\n\nThis is nothing but despicable antisemitism.",

They should not have been admitted in the first place. Especially if you aren't a diehard member of these Clubs. It basically gives all the power to these groups that make up almost none of the population at UBC. You become a member of the AMS council and do something against their wishes; gone, you'll get voted out before you can speak. You want funding for your club that isn't in line with their policies; nope, no funding for you, they will make it so that you get no funding. Want to expose these uncivilized Neanderthals for what they really are? Good Luck, they'll change the rules so that you can't do anything. The largest faculty at UBC doesn't get as much representation as they want to have. They want a super minority of students to control the largest student union in Canada. They are attempting to create a dictatorship like the DPRK and the PRC.",
            "\"should we also advocate for ending chabad's lease\" is a strange thing to say. whether or not you agree with any of the 3 petitions, the language of the petition in question seems very clear that it's specifically about hillel bc and the actions of that organization and its members on campus, not about how \"liberal\" or otherwise it is.",

            "hey this is a good point, and I'd like to explore this a bit further here in the comments, if that's okay. To preface this, I'm Asian Canadian, specifically East. I've also taken some courses in ACAM and Asian studies, so let's see what I can contribute.\n\nThe first thing I kind of want to mention is that the AMS (and undergrad societies) already lean heavily Asian anyways. I would note that East and South Asians are not underrepresented. There's absolutely less Southeast (for example Filipino), West, and Central Asian representation which could be def something to explore if an \"Asian students council\" section were to be added. Currently, for science (I'm using science because of your flair) the science council members are all Asian (I'm going off of names so idk if this is really accurate) and there are many Asian council members to begin with. The current president, the VP admin and most of the admin portfolio are East/South/Southeast Asian for example.\n\nYou could argue there isn't really PI, Central or West Asian representation, which is a fair argument and there's been many arguments about who gets represented in \"Asian\" since it tends to lean towards hegemonic groups (think East). This isn't exclusive to Asian/AAPI and minority communities within minorities will have a harder time finding representation/being heard.\n\nThe second thing is that this petition reflects the current situation in world politics, and that the results (the groups noted should be given additional seats) more or less reflect that. Another poster mentioned the lack of Disabled student representation (for instance why was DUC left out?) and we could also point out that several other \"visible minority\" groups were not mentioned such as Latin American/Latino/Latinx. Intersectionality is important to note here and I'm supposing that the petition writers are hoping that the concerns of groups left out will be raised by those who hold intersecting identities.\n\nOf course, what you're raising up is more about the specific fact that Asian students orgs or just the entire group were left off of the student organizations vying for additional council seats. Most of the orgs noted are pre-existing groups serving specific student populations' interests and probably created the petition together. For instance, the BSU and Black Void UBC are specific organizations that serve Black students' interests at UBC. There isn't exactly an Asian students union or an org like it (that encompasses \"Asian\" as a whole)  to serve the interests of Asian students in general and I can see why Asian students weren't considered. Heck, CJUBC (climate justice ubc) isn't endorsing it because the petitions didn't really consult Indigenous studetns/the Indigenous committee (heard on the grapevine).\n\nLastly, we could also argue that a sizeable population of Asian students have a lot of apathy concerning the AMS and haven't publicly raised the issue (other than posting on reddit) or forming working groups or whatever. Maybe we should be asking why Asian students are not involved in organizing representation for our interests and needs/concerns. Even Esmé Decker, who was AMS president previously and also Asian, ran an Anti-Racism platform without noting anti-Asian racism. They also didn't respond to the AMA question asking about it, so.... at this point you might as well start your own Asian student union or something to get Asian students' concerns heard.  I'm willing to help as well.",

            "Several in a masters level program that covered a lot of statistics. The statistics wasn’t the issue, although it was essentially taught like it was a first year course for mathematically illiterate psychology students, and offered nothing of value to anyone with any interest in understanding what’s going on as none of the mathematics was covered. \n\nThe issue was that it was taught by someone who was absolutely the worst lecturer I have ever seen. I was in this program after my second masters, and after almost finishing a PhD. \n\nThe same instructor decided to do 2 weeks on linear algebra. Absolutely basic first year linear algebra that should have been assumed knowledge of everyone in the program. I have taught that course several times, and if they paid me 1/5 of the amount they paid this guy for teaching it my fellow masters students would have understood the material better, which should have already been fully absorbed into their bones long ago.\n\nBut the goal wasn’t to train people who could do new things of any kind. It was to cash in on an already ridiculously oversaturated job market, while marketing the field as very promising for incoming professionals. There was no help with finding work. Instructors even had us go through coursera courses in lieu of being competent to teach the material. This was a masters degree within the sciences at UBC.\n\nThere were no real industry connections who were hiring people full time from the program, with maybe 3 exceptions—which was a matter of the dice role of your capstone project assignment. \n\nMost of my graduating class from that program are either unemployed, employed in another completely unrelated area, or employed in the area VERY precariously. Maybe 4-6 people out of the 40 or so people have genuinely stable employment, and this was before the lay offs started happening.",

Now as a self identified indigenous applicant, they have said this essay will be adjudicated by the indigenous adjudication committee for the indigenous specific awards. I have a few questions, \n\n1. Will they be considering me for just the indigenous PSA award or other indigenous awards aswell?\n\n2. How much should i be writing? there were no specifics given and the little box i enter into afterwards doesn’t have a character limit. \n\n3. probably don’t know the answer but how many indigenous applicants does ubc approximately receive ?

In general, all of the Indigenous awards are done through one application, but you do have to specify which ones you're eligible for. Good luck and welcome to UBC!",

Welcome aboard- this is a random note, but one thing to anticipate is the grade plummet that throws first years off, keep up good study habits",

I tried asking about a concession and he told me it would be really difficult to get it approved since I had already written the test, which basically means no.\n\nI’m wondering if I should just reach out to my instructor directly but idk it’ll probably be the same response.\n\nMy advisor also said (in relation to the noise and distractions) that the CFA was a ‘distraction reduced’ environment and not ‘distraction free’ and obviously it’s not possible to be distraction free but this testing room was 100% not distraction reduced, and if anything was distraction increased lol… in what world is constant chatter and movement considered ‘distraction reduced?’ Not even in my non-CFA exams have I ever experienced disruption to that extent. \n\nI really appreciate the work the CFA and my advisor do and I know they’re trying to address these issues but imo more has to be done (more employees and funding, better management, etc.)\n\nJust really disappointed but I guess I just have to take the L lol",

            "I agree about it being a distraction increased environment lol. The constant noises in the test centre actually cause me further distress on top of the exam. The CFA test centre is so loud (even with ear plugs) that exams in lecture halls are less distracting in comparison.",
            "honestly i took an exam with the CFA today and it was so loud in there too :/ usually it’s fine but lately my experiences with them haven’t been the best, I also found that some of the staff members were pretty rude",
            "Guys what, I just got a email saying that CFA and CS department made a error with my midterm. UBC needs better regulations for examinations, I have had now three exams with an error within the past two weeks. Idk what the problem is but idc what the excuse is, we paid for these courses and yet they continue to mess up smh",
            "i’m so sorry :( i have been thinking of registering with CFA but it literally sounds like they’re so horrible 😭",
            "Can you try explaining that the distraction reduction environment they offered isn’t a sufficient accommodation? Maybe rather than trying to convince them they’re doing a shitty job (which it sounds like they are) focus on how your need for accommodation is continuing to be unmet. And ask for your accommodation to be changed to a private room (or maybe semi private or something). \n\nCFA set me up once to write an exam from a recording booth in the basement one time, and it was the best exam experience ever. Total silence. :) good luck!",
            "I’m not sure if you’re taking it in the big rooms, but there are small rooms if you have “distraction free“ accommodation. They are so much better, I have by chance been allocated that a few times and it’s great, because I get to talk to myself as well whiles writing and it helps me think. \n\nBut I also don’t worry too much about already having have done your exam. This happened to me my first semester here where it took a really long time to get my accommodation so I had to sit the regular exam. Once I got my accommodation and also did another exam in that class where I can prove that I did significantly better I emailed the professor to see if I can get my grades shifted. I asked whether I could get it so my final grade counts for all, or if the distribution can be changed because of the lack of accommodation.\n\nI would say for now get your accommodation acquired. Book an office hour with your instructor explain to them the situation, and what do you intend to do. Don’t email it’s a personal when they’re less likely to help.",
            "For anyone interested (including OP), I’m trying to get some change done but I think my impact is pretty minimal as one individual alone. It would be great if we could mobilize a bigger group, feel free to DM me!",

            "First time with CFA, my invigilator was watching a soccer game on his phone and talking to himself 🥲 I changed my letter to include “private room”.",
            "Other people’s experiences with CFA is not generally the same for others. They can be a really big help, especially in terms of providing you with accommodations. The process with CFA does take time, so do try and register and book an appointment as soon as you can, especially with more exams and finals later in the term.",
            "Register! I have the exam accommodation but I only use it for finals in big rooms (SRC, LIFE etc.) and they’re *usually* a bit more careful for finals. Even if you don’t do that, it’s great to have the CFA behind you if in a documentation sense if you ever need a concession or any sort of extra support because of your disability. I have found my advisor to be entirely unhelpful, but having my CFA documentation and the option to use the exam accommodation has alleviated so much stress for me across many situations.",
            "Register! My advisor is wonderful and had no issues thus far. I think it does depend on your advisor and your needs/disability. I was guaranteed all my accommodations from the school I transferred from at ubc plus some. Everyone’s experience is different. If they aren’t helpful u don’t have to continue using them.",
            "You should register! Even though I haven't had very good experiences in the test centre, my other accommodations have still helped me a lot. All the CFA advisors I've spoken to have been very kind and supportive as well.",
            "This\\^ The rooms upstairs are a lot quieter, they're usually 3-5 people in a room and the stomping is better too.   \nAlso, buy some rubber/silicone earplugs - they're a LOT better than those foam ones at reducing noise.",
            "Omg wtf… that’s absurd!!!",
            "thank you for the reply!! it’s so nerve-wracking because a lot of the people i’ve seen talk about it on here and people i know say some of the CFA people can be super awful and that makes me sooo worried…\n\nhow long did it take for you to get registered with them? did you find you really had to advocate for yourself — like did they listen to you? did they like recommend what sort of accommodations there are or do you suggest them yourself?",
            "true!! i just hope i get a helpful advisor 🤞",
            "that’s reassuring, i’m just nervous i might get an advisor that won’t help but i’m just gonna hope for the best!! :)",
            "I’m sure there are advisors that are less kind, but that’s an unfortunate barrier we need to overcome when we advocate for ourselves. If your advisor makes you uncomfortable I would just email the CFA being like “hey, I don’t think person X was the right fit for me, could I see a different advisor moving forward?” \n\nI registered (submitted the medical documentation etc.) towards the end of summer (late August) before the first week rush really kicked in, and my intake appointment where you meet your advisor and discuss accommodations was in late September. This wait time would be significantly longer in the thick of the school year I think. \n\nFor me, while my advisor has been mostly unhelpful when I have reached out for assistance throughout the year, they were quite understanding during my intake appointment and suggested certain accommodations based on issues I said I struggled with, but I imagine I could have also just said which specific accommodations I needed, but in my case I just wasn’t sure what options I had lol.",
            "One recommendation I have is try to figure out what type of accommodations that could help you. Even if it seems ridiculous to you. I believe most advisors give extra time on exam’s (most get 1.25 it seems) regardless of disability but I’m not sure. Search the subreddit for posts about what accommodations others have or post your own. \n\nHere’s mine to give u an idea (I have epilepsy so my accommodations are to help avoid seizures and not mess up my school should I have one): 1.5x on exams, excused attendance for medical reasons, one exam per day, lecture material given to me if not already posted, and extensions w/ notice.",
            "ahhh ok thank you sm for the information :-) it helps to know what to expect!!",
            "thank you!! i’ve been looking what some people have been saying on here and i’ve definitely gotten some ideas what will be helpful for me :-) definitely need excused absences and extensions!!",
            "np! prepare to advocate for yourself in case u have a hard ass advisor. Idk how students are assigned advisors. At my old institution it was based on the students faculty. I haven’t heard much about the others but I hope u get mine :)\n\nGood luck! Feel free to dm me if u want help or support with navigating the system.",
            "Thank you so much!! i’ve heard you really do need to advocate for yourself so that’s making me a bit nervous 😥 if i have any questions ill ask you!! :)",
            "trust me it’s not that scary :)! go into it with an open mind. I was lucky and didn’t have to as I had old accommodation letters to back me up. My advisor just gave me everything like she was trying to give me more. Also definitely start the process as soon as u have everything in order. There appointments are often 1 month out. Just know there are good advisors out there :)",
            "yep!! i’ve already put in the form to schedule an appointment :-) i only get to see my doc in about a week and a half anyway for him to hopefully give me my diagnosis and documentation 🤞🤞",

I’d recommend you talk to someone and seek support for it, as that is one of the best ways to get your feet back up. Take it slowly, step by step. \n\nDon’t be afraid to ask your prof for extensions or connect with academic advisors. You deserve the help you need, and don’t feel bad if you are overwhelmed and decide to drop a course with a W on transcript. Health is a priority.",

If this is at all true for you, try to remind yourself to just get ready and physically go to the place (eg. class), and then decide how much energy you have. Also this is pretty normal around this time, there's a reason why reading break is when it is!

So I’ve been weaning off of them slowly and one by one, under supervision of my doctors and overall I’ve still been okay. \nI do agree and think that it’s probably burnout right now because I know that last two weeks there was just wayyyy too much going on.

            "It depends. I've been in the mental health field for over a decade. It's hard to see a patient go from feeling hopeless at the beginning, to being hopeful and thriving, only to stop their meds because they \"felt good,\" only to crash. It's super common with bipolar disorder, which, unfortunately, is a chronic illness. In these cases, they have to stay on medication. Period. I guess I get concerned when I see someone make a blanket statement about not being on meds forever. Sometimes, it's a life-saving necessity."

            "I have a lot of opinions on the UTP. As an entirely anecdotal story, most of the people I've met from that program (all very smart and kind) do have some pretty intense degree of anxiety and resentment around the program. \n\nWhen these programs are brought up, I always wonder if their 4 years of high school could've been used better to give them the education, as well as teaching them age appropriate social skills and coping mechanisms. \n\nI took some classes at Harvard when I was 17, and met a girl who was finishing up her psych degree that she started when she was 12. No master's program would take her for clinical psychology and she ended up moving back to Texas and working at a car wash. She was very bright and probably could have put her education to more use if her childhood wasn't all spent on academics. \n\nI think these programs miss the point of what adolescence and high school gives you - space to learn who you are and try new things, fail and learn how to fail gracefully, and how to get back up again. Not just academic, but socially and in every other facet. These skills are crucial for thriving in a pressure cooker like a large university. I feel bad for the students who missed out on this development stage.",
            "Part of the problem is being phenomenal in high school isn’t a good indicator that you can handle university because high school is so easy.\n\nThey need to increase the intensity of high schools so students aren’t blindsided when they start taking rigorous university courses, but there would be too much pushback as it would hurt student’s admission potential to top schools.",
            ">The University Transition Program for Gifted Students (TPGS, also known as UTP) enrolls 20 of the province’s smartest students aged 13-15 each year and offers a two-year preparation program for early entrance to university studies. It was founded by B.C.’s education ministry, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) and the University of British Columbia.\nThose selected can enter UBC following the completion of the two-year UTP program and skip regular secondary education, which takes five years.\n\nWhat would you be doing if you finished high school in only 2 years and started UBC when your peers are in grade 10?",

            "There's a similar program for accelerated high school in the school district I lived in. A lot of people I knew through \"gifted\" programs attended it. I will say that they seemed happy to be academically challenged, but they also seemed kind of lacking in their ability to get along with people outside the program. I'm really glad I chose not to attend it because I think it's definitely more important in the long term to have good social skills. I honestly think it's good BC high school is so easy because I got to do a bunch of extracurriculars and explore my passions.",
            "People are pointing at a lack of social skills as if it's a symptom rather than a preexisting condition. There's a degree of self-selection for the type of people who apply to this kind of program and there's further self-selection for the type of people who decide to go through it. \n\nYou're looking at a group of people who \\*decided\\* not to have 4 years of high school.",

Not just academic, but socially and in every other facet. These skills are crucial for thriving in a pressure cooker like a large university. I feel bad for the students who missed out on this development stage.\n\nThis kind of just turned into a senseless rant so don't take it too seriously, it's not really targeted at you. \n\nI'd argue most Canadian highschools miss this point. In fact, I'd say the vast majority of students who did highschool the regular low academic standard Canadian system way (can't fail even if you tried) were the most miserable in UBC, because highschool was so comedically easy that they never faced any academic challenges before getting into UBC. It's certainly not true that a regular highschool program is accomplishing any of these things when it comes to preparing for success at UBC. The students that are produced by these regular highschool programs came in thinking they were incredibly academically gifted since they could get a 100% without even studying outside of school hours that they had their entire world view chattered after their first midterms. \n\nThe most well adjusted social students I saw were the ones who came from academically challenging high school programs that had basically taught/introduced the entirety of the first year curriculum and so they were able to avoid hard classes using AP credit, they had already been forced to develop their study habits when the stakes were much lower from the comfort of their homes. Those were the students that were actually social in university since they weren't playing academic catch-up for years worth of academic rigors. The students that went to IB/private schools/schools that offered AP courses/accelerated programs were able to get into their dream majors in 2nd year (at a much higher rate than the alternatives) and actually pursue their academic goals at a much higher success rate, while the students who weren't academically prepared coming into UBC had to give up on their intended majors, switch career goals, spend extra years/money making up for their academic woes from first year to get into their desired programs. \n\nI am friends with the two extremes, the guy who took IB and basically told me at the end of first year that he hadn't been taught anything new in university so far, was significantly more fulfilled after getting into his dream major while my other friends either flunked out or ended up spending 4 years of their lives studying a worthless major that they didn't care about because they had to settle for it with their lower grades. The students who didn't get challenged in highschool are the ones who get weeded out in first year after taking on loans and I promise you from what I've seen that's a much bigger hit to someone's mental health than skipping a year or two of highschool. My friends who went to regular highschools and are on their 3rd attempts to get into their desired competitive programs are much less socially fulfilled than my friends who were in the gifted intensive programs, that ended up landing full rides to Stanford/Princeton and who are already married and bringing in mid 6 figure incomes. I promise you there's no significant differences in intelligence, it's just a difference in opportunity and efficiency. Neither side is more socially developed.    \n\nI am now in a post graduate program that has well over a hundred students ranging from ages 20-32 and I couldn't really point out any discernable social differences between the extremes, in fact I'd argue the 21 year old's who went through these accelerated programs are much more well put together since they were able to pursue their goals without wasting years of their lives being held back by systems that cater to the average. At the very least they appear to be much less bitter. You won't find any academically rigorous program that isn't filled with anxiety. Giving bright academic students less options to challenge themselves and grow will cause much more harm than good.",
            "You make good points, but I have to disagree with the socializing thing. I'm actually from the program, so I know a bunch of classmates (from my year and otherwise) who have that anxiety and resentment you mentioned. The program is definitely not for everyone, but regular high school is worse for some people in the social aspect. \n\nI got rejected from the program when I was 12, so I did a year of normal high school before going into it again. It was probably the worst year of my life and I was considering doing something extreme if I had to do it for 4 years. It had nothing to do with academics but rather the fact that I was unable to communicate with my peers and teachers. I quite literally had 0 friends and teachers disliked me as well despite me excelling academically. \n\nArguably, that is my responsiblity to learn how to socialize, but I also believe that teachers should take some initiative to guide students who are struggling. I knew many other students who had the same issue as me (to be fair, I don't know what became of them; maybe they ended up adjusting well in the end), and none of them were able to find any solutions while I was there. \n\nAt UTP, because there were only 40 students and like 4 teachers, everyone knew each other and I was finally able to learn how to connect with and trust people after terrible experiences in elementary school and my 1 year of high school. Some of my classmates at UTP also had a similar experience as me, where they were never able to even begin learning socialization until entering the program. I made friends there where we have literally travelled across the country because one of us needed help, or went to their place at 3 AM because they needed it, etc. Some of us simply wouldn't have made a support network on this level, or at all, in \"normal\" high school. \n\nThis is not discounting the experience of those who have suffered there. I am only taking issue with the notion that normal high school is *universally* better than these types of programs.",
            ">No master's program would take her for clinical psychology\n\nout of curiosity, do you know the reason for this? I doubt it's explicitly because of age (though I could see how certain things like conducting studies and that kind of stuff might need someone above the age of majority). Ultimately even if you completely failed to get anything out of your degree you're still at the same stage of life as those who just graduated high school, and probably a heck of a lot mature than them (and of course, like 300k down if you went to Harvard, but this is likely true of a lot of people in that program).",
            "To be honest, I think it's entirely unfair to make such a large generalization for a program that has taken in and produced so many different types of students. I've actually also met quite a few (one of my friends in elementary actually went there) UTP grads in uni as well, and I was never able to tell they were younger before they told me.\n\nAnd UTP has such a large variety of grads - each one I encountered were widely different from each other, but they all tended to excel in their courses and be incredibly academically driven. Some of them might have come out slightly socially awkward, but just as many are likely thriving and enjoying uni far more than they would've had they taken the regular route. In fact, I'd speculate that some of the students that *chose* to take 2 years instead of 5 were aware they might have suffered socially even more in typical high school.\n\nIn the end, I think there's more benefits than downsides to allowing students a more academically rigorous path to take in their life - especially given how academically stifling normal high schools are for many students. I've seen peers in high school driven to the point of frustration over the lack of academic support and challenges regular schools offered. Making such generalizations and saying the whole program is problematic is pretty unhelpful. Every high school has its fair share of successful alumni and resentful, less well-adjusted students. Who are we to say UTP isn't just like most other schools?",
            "All the kids I’ve seen come out of this smoke most normal people. I don’t think their transition to Uni difficulty is the problem since on avg I think they cope with workload better.",
            "i don't think the issue is that university is too hard for them to adjust to, but rather that the culture of UTP itself & a lack of mental health supports is harmful for the students. the people i know who did UTP did very well in university",
            "I didn’t do UTP but graduated at a normal high school three years early. If I had gone through high school with people my age I would’ve lost my mind— the lack of challenge academically was making me go crazy and I didn’t get along with people my own age at the time. Now my friends range from maybe a year younger up to even a decade older (side effects of grad school lol). \n\nI don’t think it’s for everyone, and I certainly don’t think any child should be forced to do it against their own will, but I do think the option should be available. I probably wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t an option for me. \n\nI do, however, have mixed feelings about programs like UTP where it’s a bunch of kids around people their age then being thrown into university. I think that can really mess with your social development and limits the range of people you get to meet and interact with in your formative years.",
            "How complicated is it? If you're not simply a person, then you're surely either a demi-human or fully non-human. There's a lot of higher-order beings that could be considered complicated (aliens, deities, eldritch entities etc) but only the truly Lovecraftian would be incomprehensible I'd think.",
            "I second this. As a \"gifted\" kid who was labelled that the moment I did an IQ test, I would've been so screwed if I'd skipped grades, to be honest, especially since I had undiagnosed ADHD and would've burnt out even faster than I already did in the schooling system haha. It's common in general for gifted kids to have some other divergency from the norm besides their giftedness, most of the ones I've met ended up having some neurodevelopmental condition. Not everyone of course but in those cases it can be even worse to put children into these programs because they may be able to comprehend the content intellectually but not be able to keep up with an accelerated workload. Not to mention, I actually know someone who is younger and in an accelerated program right now, it crushed their mental health, so the patterns are similar to your mom's anecdote even now.",
            "I think you're spitting facts for the majority of this. In the opposite vein, my partner went through almost pure BC 12 curriculum (added calc, was the only advanced thing available) and was bored out of his mind. \n\nSome of the same problems present in UTP are here too - if you're university bound, you're probably never failing anything and never have the chance to learn to recover with grace. The difference is that I found they had the time to learn social skills. \n\nI really enjoyed my high school experience and would love to give my kids the same opportunity - I went to a trades majority high school in MB with a super small IB program. So I did the full IB diploma, as well as taking a trade. It socialized me, gave me enough challenges, but I still had time to be around normal people. I think this is a happy medium for university-bound high schoolers. I'm definitely not the biggest defender of current standard curriculum - I think by virtue of its existence it has to be doable by the lowest common denominator. Leaving me bored, and rolling weed in class with my precal textbook until I began the IB diploma program.",
            "I spent too much time replying to the other guy so I'm too lazy to write another long response, but yeah. Your last point especially. The regular school system is still failing at what it's meant to do, so why take away more options from people? These programs are certainly not for everyone (and I mean a psychological perspective, not anything to do with intelligence), but removing them outright would harm those who do benefit from them.",
            "Either I know who this is, or this is a very common scenario.",
            "excellent choice for the clinical psyc (or any psyc) program to not accept her. it’s actually highly likely it’s because of age. do you expect a teen to become a therapist? developmentally speaking, teens have not experienced life yet and especially as our prefrontal cortex (which regulates decision making) doesn’t fully develop until our mid 20s. \n\nalso have to disagree with you about gifted students and other high school students. the gifted student will NOT be more mature and they are only academically gifted. they’re just as prone to making stupid teen decisions.",
            "Hey! It was a sad story. I haven't talked to her since 2019 so it's entirely possible she got into something as an adult - I hold out hope about this. I checked her instagram and she has kinda disappeared off the face of the Earth. It was completely because of her age. She couldn't do any practicums or even sign forms on her own behalf. \n\nShe didn't make at any friends at Harvard because she was 12. She went back to Texas at 17 and her friends had moved on and they had nothing in common anymore. She felt too smart to be back in her hometown, but she also didn't fit in at Harvard. Ironically, studying psychology so young kinda meant she didn't get people as well after. That's all I know.",
            "Now tbf my personal experience has also been that these kids have way better support systems.",
            "None of the people I've met who went through the program were particularly well adjusted, or pleasant to be around.",
            "I’ve seen people on of the program and no doubt they are extremely smart and excelled academically. The three people I know who went through the program are… lacklustre socially - we were the same age when we started working on campus, and being around university culture at a much younger age proved imo, more harm than good. One got into drinking way too early, others just didn’t fit in socially (which I don’t blame them, imagine hanging out with grade 9s while you’re in grade 12, that’s the age gap we’re talking about). I think it’s a good idea to review the program and see if it’s really a good idea to accelerate the process of going through university, and what the expense is.",
            "What if you were given the option to attend a more academically challenging school ? Full IP/AP workload with honours classes in 9-10.",
            "From my entirely anecdotal experience, I have encountered it a lot, but it’s also true that you may know me. Though I haven’t told many people this stuff outside of UTP.",
            "I will cede the point on maturity to you, given that's not my field of expertise and I'm basing it off what I've seen personally. My biggest question about acceptance is how they would even know in the first place. Personally, I would never write about that in a personal statement unless I have a strong way to address the possible issues with maturity that could come up, but maybe that shows immaturity in itself. I was also thinking more about research than therapy, but I do see now that the original comment was talking about clinical psych.",
            "Not early 20s, it is mid-to late 20s",
            "Depends on a lot. \n\nThere are a lot of interesting people in the program whom I've met, but also really clueless and childish people. It's hard to pinpoint what types of people come out of the program unless you meet tons. That's like saying that everyone from your high school is rude and unpleasant from a few experiences. At the end of the day, it's just a school, and the alumni are just people. Some clearly flawed, and others perfectly integrated into university culture.",
            "Nah I wanted a normal high school experience in the sense of still getting to take theatre and music classes, standard high school events, and not feel like something “other” with a “special” school. UTP was suggested to me when I was younger but it didn’t seem like a good idea. \n\nA huge aspect of why I skipped the grades is also social! I did not relate to people my own age and it was quite isolating. I think being in a normal high school did wonders for my social development :)\n\nEdit: actually on that point, I just remembered, they did some fancy evaluation thing when I was 12 and the results said something like “kat2210 has the knowledge and capabilities representative of a high school graduate”, so while I don’t know what the logistics would’ve been, I figure I would’ve been able to wrangle my way into university back then if my parents and I wanted it. But we didn’t, and I am SO grateful we didn’t— I learned a ton about social dynamics, interpersonal relationships, and my love for the arts during high school. No way would that have happened if I was a kid running around as a first year! I think there’s a balance to this sort of stuff, albeit difficult to find. I got lucky with my balance.",
            "agreed! imo  the most rewarding experience in HS was being a part of the jazz band and to play team sports. I don't really have much recollection of parsing the iambic pentameters in Othello, but I do recall all of the teamwork and struggles heading to regional champs.",
            "Yeah musical theatre and drama class were pivotal experiences for me in high school, I would be a VERY different person now if I missed out on those"

            ">Does anyone have any experience finding student positions in creative sectors around Vancouver? (I would prefer not to relocate due to financial reasons).\n\nI'm a former Arts Co-op student and I have ties to the publishing community here in BC through a volunteer role.\n\nI'll not lie - it will be be an uphill battle. The closest thing to a full creative co-op in Arts Co-op is the student position that Harbour Publishing puts out, and you've probably already ruled that out because it's not in Vancouver.\n\nThe challenge is that creative organizations primarily recruit from Emily Carr and Capilano University, both of which have very strong programs in comparison to UBC Arts and have student profiles that you likely won't be able to match with a background in Geography. On top of that, networking is a big thing in pure creative fields so you can't consistently rely on access to job postings.\n\nGraphic design roles aren't hard to come-by, but most of those involve marketing or corporate communications in some way - which you've said isn't something you're comfortable with. A lot of the smaller outfits don't really prioritize hard skills for this anymore because Canva exists now. If this is of interest to you, you would definitely stand out with some kind of a portfolio.\n\nThat basically leaves you with:\n\n* Apply for something unrelated and with a wide scope, and then ask if there would be opportunities to do creative work like storytelling. This is probably most viable with donor engagement and museum assistant type roles (again, this borders on marketing).\n* Apply for Arts e@UBC and start a business with creative design, such as starting a postcard pop-up store.\n* Do a self-directed co-op search and network as aggressively as you can, hitting up every creative director on LinkedIn for a coffee chat.\n* Pray and hope something comes your way (a few years ago, I was asked if I'd be interested in being a photographer for an environmental disaster response by the province out of the blue, so it happens).",
            "Thank you so much for your detailed reply!\nI figured this was the case, though I really appreciated reading your expanded perspective. I'm applying for the Creative Writing major intake for this year, so I am intending to formally study in this field in some regard. I'm more geared to writing so I figure I may not be in exactly the same fields as the other art unis?\n\nI am trying to get into networking as you suggested, and funnily enough I was also considering the entrepreneurial coop for future years! \n\nI do have hard skills and am pretty adept at the Adobe Suite (photo shop, after effects, premiere, in design, etc etc), though it's mostly for personal work and I don't really have much of a front-facing portfolio to speak of. Maybe I'll get to work assembling one, if graphic designer roles don't have too much hurdles in front of them as you mentioned!\n\nVolunteering in publishing has been something that's piqued my interest a ton lately! I was wondering how you got into it, and if you know which publishers might be interesting in taking in new people? (I wouldn't mind working a non creative job, and doing some shadowing on the side-- I'm really eager for any experience, really, and wouldn't mind working from the ground-up to upskill and learn the ropes). I've been doing some cold emailing to publishers, but haven't heard back from many yet.\n\nIf all else fails, I'll probably go for a job more related to sustainability which I have a ton more concrete experience in, and juggle creative stuff on the side.\n\nThank you so much again for your insight, it really affirmed some things I was already considering!",
            ">Graphic design roles aren't hard to come-by, but most of those involve marketing or corporate communications in some way\n\nIt's funny how there are so many people with a graphic design background who absolutely cannot and will not consider a role in communications and marketing. Anyone with good graphic design skills can get a good shot at an entry level marketing job.",
            "> I'm applying for the Creative Writing major intake for this year, so I am intending to formally study in this field in some regard. I'm more geared to writing so I figure I may not be in exactly the same fields as the other art unis?\n\nI couldn't really comment on this with any certainty. I know that quite a few creative writing majors do pivot to copywriting and technical writing, and I've even met a project manager with a creative writing background - now they [write user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories).\n\n>If all else fails, I'll probably go for a job more related to sustainability which I have a ton more concrete experience in, and juggle creative stuff on the side.\n\nI was going to mention advocacy and magazines earlier, but I honestly don't recall seeing any advocacy organizations in co-op. It's probably worth having a chat about with Arts co-op coordinators. I would imagine in both of these roles, you'd have opportunities to work with developing long-form writing, telling stories and using multi-media (i.e. [Hakai esque](https://hakaimagazine.com/) type work).\n\nGoing off of 2022 Canada Summer Jobs Funding, looks like quite a few artistic organizations, art galleries/councils, etc. get funding too and you might use the historical CSJ funding list to cold email for positions: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/funding/canada-summer-jobs/amounts-paid-2022/british-colombia.html\n\n>Volunteering in publishing has been something that's piqued my interest a ton lately!

Not gonna lie, I've been doing the same studying method since high school (re-copy my notes by hand, and keep re-reading them), and it's very much NOT time-effective (copying them by hand makes me actually slow down and read, and makes me process my notes, rather than reading them quickly but not really remembering the details), BUT it works for me, and I pass my exams.

Be sure to book an appointment at [https://www.seeyourpharmacist.ca](https://www.seeyourpharmacist.ca) beforehand so we can set some time aside and get ready for you!\n\nIf it’s your first recorded episode, it is still worth speaking to them, but do note that they may refer you for further assessment.",
            "hi! even if you are an international student, you still should have MSP. i recommend choosing a clinic (not UBC hospital) somewhere off campus and calling them about walk-ins or appointment. some of the clinics are busy, some are much freer (the appointment would be in 1-2 weeks compared to a month of wait at the UBC hospital). \ni am an international student and also suffer from period pain. \nsome clinics will have OBGYN walk ins, and some won’t but even talking to a physician will be helpful.\n\ni went to an OBGYN walk-in to ask about it and they took some tests, and said they would call if anything is wrong. they didn’t call so im guessing its ok. everything was free! \n\n\nthe OBGYN’s advice was to take advil, not tylenol. because advil is anti-inflammatory painkiller and the cramps is basically an inflammation. another advice was that if your period is regular, you can take one advil a day starting 2-3 days before period begins. i found it helped me tons. it basically removes the inflammation before it reaches its peak and i started having way more tolerable cramps. \n\n\nhope this helps!",

            "I have had problems with my period that sound very similar since high school. Mine got progressively worse (when I started my period at 11 I didn’t get cramps or anything and then they started to get really bad when I was about 18-19). When I was 14 I went to my dr because of the pain and they gave me pain meds that did nothing. Tylenol and Advil do nothing for me. My dr put me on the pill for a while to try to manage it but it made everything worse (and gave me depression). After years of complaining to my family dr at every visit, I said I thought I have endometriosis and she got me a referral to a gynaecologist who specializes in endometriosis (not all gynaecologists can treat it). Within 5 minutes she confirmed that what I was experiencing wasn’t normal and it was either the result of endometriosis or dysmenorrhea, but it’s impossible to diagnose without invasive surgery. Anyway if that sounds familiar to you or resonates with you at all, please go see a doctor and ask for a referral. It is so worth it. Especially with period pain, you have to be loud and direct with what you want, otherwise you’ll be brushed off (even by female doctors!). I had an IUD inserted in October and although it’s been rough and my body still hasn’t regulated itself, it is starting to make things much better. The first months were really rough and my cramps were the worst they’d ever been (and constant) but the potential payoff is life with no periods at all so I’ll take it. The insertion didn’t hurt as much as people told me it would (it literally just felt like my normal cramps, but I did throw up from the pain). Unfortunately there aren’t many options available for period pain. The most common treatment is the pill or an IUD. I also used to miss class constantly because of period pain and it is no fun. I’m sorry you’re dealing with it. Anyways, be loud about what you want and try to get to a specialized gynaecologist if you can. If you don’t have a family doctor, you can also for referrals from the walk-in clinic. Good luck!!"

Imagine being thrown into the role and the person you're taking over also didn't answer their emails in a timely matter now you have 1000+ emails to go through on your first day. High turnover for the position means the people working these jobs probably don't want to be there in the first place or the working conditions are terrible (or both).",

            "Yes I agree. If a staff or faculty member is overwhelmed or busy with emails they should set up an auto reply saying so. \n\nHowever if they are brand new to the system they may not know how to do this yet and also may be learning a bunch of other new things. \n\nIf you're not getting replies, then keep going to speak with an ESA or advising in person for now. That's my suggestion at least.",
            "As much as I am aware (and ofc i might be wrong here)... being able to use email, microsoft OS, etc are like some basic requirements of such jobs. Even if someone lies on their application and gets the job, if they're seeing they have 100s of old emails to get through and other tasks, they can always do a quick search on youtube for the same. Not sure if it's their fault if they don't know how to set up an auto reply or UBC's fault for not ensuring that the person they hire knows the basics or having some sort of training"

        "selftext": "I had to make a throwaway for this because posting it from my regular account would mean I'd be easily identified based on my post history. But here it goes...\n\nWant to know what makes UBC stand out for me?\n\nThe Big Dicks.\n\nAllow me to explain a bit. So I transferred in after one year from a community college in Kelowna and, without a doubt, the average dick size at UBC is bigger. Call me crazy but that's been my experience here. Keep in mind that this conclusion isn't a result of any rigorous scientific analysis or anything, but I believe it's pretty accurate. There could be a number of factors influencing why this has been the case for me. But whatever the reason, all I know is that, on average, the guys at UBC have had way bigger dicks than the guys at my community college. Since I am pretty promiscuous I think my sample size is pretty serviceable. In the three years I've been here, n > 30. At my CC, the sample wasn't quite as large but still pretty big. I also have quite a few friends at SFU and they've reported that the dicks there are on the smaller-to-average side when we discuss sizes. The same is true at UVic, though those dicks are reportedly still bigger than dicks at SFU. My friends tell me they're shocked when they hear about my experience. Our measuring procedures aren't exactly scientific, I know, but hear me out.\n\nThere were only two guys from my community college who had dicks as big as the guys at UBC. Admittedly, I will say that I didn't measure them all with a ruler but some guys were open about it enough to let me measure. It was mainly those who I slept with regularly. I never asked if I could measure their dicks if it was merely a one night stand. Often I wouldn't have access to a ruler in these situations anyway and would have been uncomfortable to ask even if I did have one on me. Fortunately, however, I was able to measure 11 men using a technique I found on this website. For the guys I slept with regularly I found opportunities to ask and surprisingly they all complied. And thus I was able to measure them carefully.\n\nFor the rest of the men, I banked on the fact that I have a pretty good eye for size and paid extra attention to every guy's size. I've been mentally keeping track of dick sizes since I was in high school. It's just this sort of weird, funny ranking system I have in my head. And I've been able to ballpark dick sizes to the nearest 1/8th of an inch. I also have an acute ability to gauge the size of a cock based on how deep it fits in my mouth. While it is true that the girth often affects my ability to measure length as girthier cocks are more troublesome to put my mouth around, I still am able to control for this and gauge accurately the length. I didn't think much of it all until last year when I realized that the dicks at UBC were way bigger than the dicks from my past. For all the sizes, I've kept a log of data points.\n\nAnyway back to the analysis. So it seems like every guy I've slept with here, and I've slept with quite a few\\*, seems to be at least .7 - 1.2 inches bigger than the non-UBC dicks I've experienced. If you know anything about mean penis sizes this is quite significant. The interquartile range for dicks here has been like 6.5 - 7.1 inches erect in my experience, which is INSANE. The average size of an erect human penis in the country is 5.17 inches long, erect. I found UBC dicks tend to be girthier as well. So not only are they longer they are thicker as well, which has made for some great experiences in bed, though I must say that big dicks don't always predict great sex. But it does help when you know how to use that thing, just saying.\n\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around this. Could it be that the guys that I'm attracted to are attractive to me because they are so confident—confidence that stems from the fact that they have a big dick? If this is the case then maybe I'm unconsciously pre-selecting guys (confident guys) who are more likely to have big dicks, thus biasing my sample as a convenience sample. The thing is, though, that at my CC I was also attracted to confident guys and the dicks simply weren't as big as they are here.\n\nOr maybe it's the fact that UBC just attracts students with bigger dicks in general? Students who are in shape, confident and really smart of course. I think the Vancouver lifestyle really pressures people to either conform to this lifestyle or attracts people who already align with it. And that guys who end up here are the type of guys who have big dicks, i.e. guys who are happier and more secure and more likely to be all about their appearance and style stemming from their big dick energy and confidence, perhaps? Idk. Lots of conjecture here. But I just want to try to make sense of this with a working theory.\n\nI think big dick guys just want to live in Vancouver, are attracted to the lifestyle and decide to matriculate here. Whatever the reason, dicks here have been bigger in my experience than at my community college and beyond. And, according to reports from a big sample of my friends at other schools, UBC dicks are bigger than dicks at SFU and UVic too.",

Think about it this way: Looking at guys in the top 0.5 percent of confidence-in-hooking-up at UBC would equate to like 150 people, while at a small community college that might be like 5-10 people. And of course you need them to be attracted to you back, which narrows it down even more. Basically there are just a larger number of guys so you get to be more choosey.",

How should I go about telling her?\n\nThe full story: So basically during the first week of classes, our professor said that any graphs or equations seen throughout her course are just visual aid, and that understanding them was optional, so we wont see them on the exams. Having heard this, I ignored studying anything relating to equations or graphs, mostly focusing on vocabulary. Now, suddenly this professor is telling us all of these graphs are actually VERY important to the exam, and as she hands us our first actual assignment for the class, my heart sinks as everything is just completely foreign graphs and math. \n\nI’ve thought all day about if it would be possible to catch up with everything i was originally told to ignore (which is A LOT) but my brain cannot confidently see a scenario where it’s physically possible to do considering were in the middle of midterm season and my other classes have been very demanding on me.\n\nSo of course, the next option could be to drop the course with a W standing. I am leaning much more to this option because my GPA is already getting scarily low. The biggest hurdle comes with telling all of this to my Mother, the person who pays for my courses. I feel awful about this because I feel like I have wasted her money simply because I chose to believe the words of my professor. \n\nI have already scheduled a meeting with an academic advisor on Friday, and then on Saturday I was gonna break the news to my Mom, cause that’s when I will have a lot less on my plate so I can easily do what needs to be done and also mentally deal with her response\n\nPlease tell me any advice you may have.",

In real life if you were to calculate this you might be better off just taking the gauss, but number of computations wise long term breaking down the matrix and solving by back/forward substitution is much faster. While doing the matrix decomposition still takes a while you can reuse that decomposition for solving other sets of linear equations with the same coefficient matrix. Courses past first year aren't really going to be having you sit there solving by gauss since it takes so long."

Something you might consider is, today’s job market belongs to employers and not employees. They can afford to ghost because there is supply.\n\nAnd the university doesn’t have nearly as strong a network or tie-ups with other universities to impose blacklists on companies that continually ghost students.

Been doing that for the past two years and absolutely love what I do now! Got this gig through volunteer work I did throughout my undergrad so that definitely helped in this situation. It is a journey seeing what is out there. A bunch of my arts friends ventured to different thing (government jobs, marketing, UBC Alumni relations, teaching, accounting, etc.) It is ambiguous and it is daunting. I don’t know what advice I have to help besides just being kind to yourself in this journey. It isn’t easy, alot of self doubt comes up, LinkedIn is the worst platform to be on as you see what others are doing. I was fortunate to end up where I’m at now, don’t know what I would be doing otherwise (I had a part time contract job offer with UBC at the same time I got an offer for my current job, that offer was leveraged based on what I did for work at UBC in my undergrad with my worklearn job and I don’t know what wouldve happened after that year) and I don’t know what comes after this job.

If not, having a BA is better than nothing but still expect to start at the bottom of the ladder. Starting position pay is likely not going to be great, but entry into your industry/ career path is important. \n\nSeriously start pumping out applications. Tailor your cover letters. Use Jobscan and Chat GPT for help. \n\nIf you do not currently have a job do your best to get one, even if you don’t want it because having an active/ concurrent job history makes you employable. Even if you just hold the job for a month while you find something better it will make finding the next job easier. \n\nInternships are paid, find new grad opportunities.\n\nIf you want to teach highscool history should qualify you, you might just need a course or two.",

Look up qualifcations and experience required for entry level job postings for random white collar work/ office work. What they ask for is really not 'entry' level. \n\nThe other thing, and I know everyone has heard it but y'all HAVE to start networking now. Start looking for a way in. I know too many people who only have jobs because they knew someone who could get them in.\n\nOtherwise, make sure you graduate with a high GPA + make strong connections with profs so you can apply to grad school.",
            "i’m hoping to major in history too and i was wondering if you could give out any pointers or tips for networking specific to your field ? :,)",
            "That is good advice, especially the \"don't filter yourself out for a role\" part. Thanks for sharing!\n\nAre there any tricks to landing a job at UBC? I noticed a lot of arts students on LinkedIn have been employed by UBC.",
            "Thanks for sharing!\n\nWhat sort of volunteer work were you doing? And for how long?",
            "Excellent advice... I landed a job for \"co-op\" by applying outside of the co-op program roles, which tend to be hypercompetitive.",
            "I've had something like 4 interviews (out of say, 100 applications) for contract/seasonal jobs but I've always been picked over people with more experience.\n\nInternships are very rare for arts grads in my experience.  There's always internships for students though, I definitely wish I was still a student. The federal and provincial government occasionally have programs for post-grads but they've been looking at people with background in tech or finance degrees. \n\nIt's a struggle.",
            "Heyo!\n\nWhat I say here is IMO ofc so do take what you want and discard the rest.\n\n\\---\n\n\\- First: throw the misconception/subconscious mindset that doing an Arts degree is \"useless\" and that you will be unemployed. Many of my tech friends right now are getting fired and many of my friends in Sciences are not doing too hot either. Accept that it's kind of a shit show and that the best thing you can do is study what you love and show people your passion and the skills you pick up while surviving undergrad.  I would also sprinkle in a comment here that in many cases, most jobs for most folks outside of Finance and Engineering isn't exactly spectacular so kinda accept that life and capitalism isn't very slay rn...? Most of my friends have two jobs at this point. I guess understand that life isn't popping for most people rn and that shared despair might make you feel slightly better.\n\n\\- Make connections with your profs (I might suggest doing Honours). Many profs in History are linked with community work and can help you network into that community. ALSO ask your profs if they know what their former students are doing now, and see if you can ask them to introduce them to you or if you can connect on LinkedIn or smt. My current job came from talking with someone in the organization who was also a UBC History major.\n\n\\- Be broad, and be open to opportunities, as well as your scope of ideas on what brings you fulfilment --> when I was in undergrad, I thought I wanted to be a teacher (lol) but then I realized broadly that my passion in life was broadly helping people, and this allowed me to not get tunnel visioned into work that \\*only\\* pertained to a very strict idea of teaching.\n\n\\- Understand your degree and what it actually stands for: An Arts degree means that you have looooots of soft skills like reading really quickly and digesting lots of info over a short time (or bullshitting work, haha), decent/good writing skills, good interpersonal skills (the quirky conversations you can have about things that you are interested in is actually a great charm offensive), aaaand special quirks (my niche love for music history and sexuality ended up helping get gigs as a media personnel at music festivals, designing one of the largest music festivals in Vancouver, and eventually doing research into the queer EDM community at raves, which is now the topic of my PhD)\n\n\\- Do not compare yourself to others --> your story and your path might not look like others but trust me: the work we do postgrad as Art students tends to be dynamic, fun, and fulfilling. I have so much fun organizing music festivals, making museum exhibits, and also work with community members (Queer, Chinese and Indigenous elders and stakeholders) in doing cool projects. Is it where I thought I would be? No. But hey it fills my heart with purpose I guess haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I guess I am already a pretty public figure so if anyone wanted to check out my path in academia, work and projects my UBC profile is: [https://history.ubc.ca/profile/aydin-quach/](https://history.ubc.ca/profile/aydin-quach/)\n\nMy personal website with my CV is: [https://www.aydinquach.com/](https://www.aydinquach.com/)",
            "volunteering specifically in the same program as the role I do now. It’s a unique program where we do overnight camps in the summer so I’d volunteer for 1-2 weeks pretty much every year of my undergrad as a camp counselor",
            "Really good point! Also saved the co-op program fees :D"

However, they are not a legal entity on their own, and are instead a Resource Group [under the umbrella of the AMS](https://www.ams.ubc.ca/support-services/resource-groups/), our student union, which is in turn, legally its own independent registered society. They're funded through a mixture of funding from the AMS, including the [$1.98 that you pay each year](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/fees/student-fees/student-fees-established-and-approved-student-society#:~:text=AMS%20Resource%20Groups%20Fee) to fund AMS resource groups.\n\n# Preface:\n\nI feel obligated to preface this by saying that I fundamentally support and admire the work that the SJC is doing when it comes to advocacy on these important issues (including with Palestine), but as someone who has never opted out of the resource group fee, I feel obligated to say when I believe my money is being used as a **step back for social justice and equity** instead of being used to strengthen it. I have zero connections to the AMS except as a fee-paying student so I'm only writing this **in the best interests of making the SJC's advocacy stronger and more inclusive**.\n\n# (1) The SJC is using your student fees to launch risky lawsuits.\n\n>[\"UBC student group sues Jewish non-profit and former contractor, claiming defamation over pro-Hamas stickers\"](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ubc-student-group-sues-jewish-non-profit-former-contractor-over-defamation-1.7109363) *(CBC News)*  \n>  \n>[\"Social Justice Centre sues Hillel BC and former contractor for defamation\"](https://www.ubyssey.ca/news/sjc-hillel-lawsuit-filed/) *(Ubyssey)*\n\nTl;dr: the SJC launched a joint lawsuit against Hillel BC and their former contractor for posting stickers stating that the SJC \"loves Hamas\" onto pro-Palestine posters. (Will not comment further for rule #8).\n\nTwo major red flags: (1) It'll be an uphill battle to win the lawsuit, given vague connections to Hillel BC, and they might even be **counter-sued** for legal fees (2) Since they're under the AMS and are not their own entity, **costs of legal fees and repercussions will be directed to us, students**, through the AMS.\n\nWhile I respect that the SJC should be allowed to use their allocated funding however they see fit under their mandate, it's **financially and legally irresponsible** to launch unprecedented lawsuits while making the student body bear the brunt of any resulting costs since they're not their own entity, especially when it runs the risk of being counter-sued for even more money.\n\n# (2) The SJC is trying to take over AMS governance and subvert the votes of students.\n\n>[*https://linktr.ee/solidarityubc*](https://linktr.ee/solidarityubc)  \n>  \n>*Links to referendum petitions.*  \n>  \n>[*https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Gxm-dP00q/?img\\_index=1*](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Gxm-dP00q/?img_index=1)  \n>  \n>*UBC SJC Instagram post*\n\nTrust me, I hate the AMS as much as anyone, but here's why you should care.\n\nTl;dr: The SJC has launched petitions to get 3 referendum items in the next AMS election later this year. One of these includes a proposal to add 99 voting AMS Council members from SJC and allied groups, including the ability to expel any member from the AMS based on a 2/3 resolution from those representatives of these groups. This is based on the premise that marginalized groups need greater representation on AMS Council.\n\nThis is HIGHLY problematic for a number of reasons:\n\n**(i) While this is supposed to add representation of minority voices, it concentrates this power in the hands of a few, non-representative selected groups.**\n\nFor reference, here are the groups who would be allocated these special seats:\n\n1. Black Student Union (AMS Club)\n2. Black Void UBC (non-AMS affiliated group (according to their Instagram))\n3. UBC Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (AMS Club)\n4. Social Justice Centre (AMS Resource Group)\n5. UBC Trans Coalition (student group, unaffiliated)\n6. Women’s Centre (AMS Resource Group)\n7. Indigenous students\n\nHow are we adding marginalized voices when we're excluding the majority of minority student voices? Why are we sidelining other minority voices including but not limited to the Pride Collective, student disability advocacy groups, and basically all other AMS clubs based on culture, ethnicity, or nationality? To pick and choose which marginalized groups deserve more representation is regressive to social justice, particularly when some of these groups have no formal ties to the AMS or students.\n\nFurther, why should these selected, non-representative groups in particular hold the majority of power to make decisions on behalf of the entire student body?\n\n**(ii)** **This much dilutes the vote of the broader student body.**\n\nThere's nothing wrong in principle with increased representation for marginalized groups. This is a model that has been done in many other non-profits, student unions, and legislative bodies of countries.\n\nHowever, *a tiny minority of voters should never hold the vast majority of power*. While AMS Council elections can be really dumb, I still appreciate being able to have decision-makers that I elect instead of having a small, fringe group be able to completely veto the broader wishes of the UBC student community.\n\n**(iii) The SJC (and allies) would have the power to strip their opponents of AMS membership entirely.**\n\nAs proposed, this would be via a 2/3 resolution from the special Council representatives of SJC and aforementioned allies.\n\nThis means if you so dare get on their bad side, they're able to completely remove your access to:\n\n1. The AMS health and dental plan\n2. U-Pass\n3. AMS Clubs\n4. AMS Sexual Assault Support Centre\n5. and many more...\n\nYeah... I don't have to explain why this runs a dangerous precedent.\n\n# What needs to be done?\n\nThe UBC SJC needs to:\n\n1. **Immediately retract** **their risky joint lawsuit** against Hillel BC and their former contractor to minimize financial and legal burdens to the broader student body.\n2. **Immediately cancel and review** **Petition 3**, \"A NEW STUDENT UNION\" before the referendum goes forward.\n\nThe AMS needs to:\n\n1. **Immediately sever legal involvement** from the lawsuit on behalf of students.\n2. **Use SJC budgets/accounts** under the AMS for all **SJC-initiated legal fees.**\n3. **Vote for a stance against Petition 3** if it goes to AMS Council for support before the referendum.\n\n# Wow that seems shitty, what can I do?\n\n**\\[1\\] Talk about it / upvote this post.**\n\nThe SJC relies on the support of students, both financially and politically. The current leadership cannot be given support to push these initiatives under the guise of social justice and equity on behalf of UBC students.\n\n**\\[2\\] Send a quick message to the SJC, AMS leadership, and the Ubyssey to indicate your concerns.**\n\n* [socialjusticecentre.ubc@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticecentre.ubc@gmail.com)\n* [president@ams.ubc.ca](mailto:president@ams.ubc.ca)\n* [vpadmin@ams.ubc.ca](mailto:vpadmin@ams.ubc.ca)\n* [feedback@ubyssey.ca](mailto:feedback@ubyssey.ca)\n* Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/ubcsocialjusticecentre/](https://www.instagram.com/ubcsocialjusticecentre/)\n\nA quick copy-paste message is as followed:\n\n>***Subject (if applicable):***  \n>  \n>Re: UBC SJC Lawsuit and Petition 3  \n>  \n>***Message:***  \n>  \n>Attn: UBC Social Justice Centre and the UBC AMS,  \n>  \n>I am gravely concerned about the new direction of the UBC Social Justice Centre in undertaking risky lawsuits and attempting to stack AMS governance systems. These actions are regressive to fighting for social justice on campus and beyond, and as a fee-paying student, I am calling for a critical review of these initiatives to ensure the long-term sustainability of student advocacy at UBC.  \n>  \n>Please retract the aforementioned initiatives as soon as possible.  \n>  \n>Sincerely,  \n>  \n>A concerned student\n\n**\\[3\\] If the initiatives go forward, opt-out of AMS Resource Group fees in the upcoming school year.**\n\nStudents have a right to resort to divestment tactics too. (Although I sincerely hope this isn't the situation because these Resource Groups do a lot of valuable work!)\n\n**\\[4\\] Have faith in student advocacy and student voices.**\n\nNot sure why I'm reiterating this, but I have a lot of faith in the power of the SJC and other student advocacy movements. It's not easy fighting to make our communities at UBC and beyond into better places, and I want people to know that their efforts aren't unnoticed!\n\nHowever, it's important to call out when advocacy is clearly heading the wrong direction, and I think most students can agree that we want our student fees to be going towards initiatives that are truly  sustainable, inclusive, and properly representative of the student body. It's important to not be combative, but to work constructively in solidarity to advance better advocacy for not just a few student groups, but for all students at UBC.",

Eventually went up to Peugeot (spelling idk) and came back around to trafalgar, where they told me i passed. was basically only in the 30 zones the entire time. i did go through one weird intersection where it goes from a stop sign to a roundabout but i can’t remember the street now, but you’ll know it when you see it! if they take u there just go slow, that’s what i did and it was totally fine. \nthere were a lot of school zones, and i took my test right when school was let out, so i was extra careful and it was really busy. not sure what ur time is but be aware that trafalgar elementary (school right behind ICBC) is CRAZY busy and that street is really narrow. just go slow and hope for the best! \ni’ve heard they sometimes take you to the “highway” near campus but i didn’t have to, i stayed in 30 zones basically the whole time. they also didnt take me through the construction zone along king ed near the schools up there (idk the streets) but i did ask ahead of time if he would and he was like “no way.” i recommend asking if they’ll take u that way before you take your test to clarify speeds and stuff to demonstrate you know the area well. \nmake sure you know how to turn on the defrost and how everything inside the car you’re driving works too! and hand signs, they do it on this test too.\ni got my N in October 2021 in Langley, took the test nearly exactly two years after. i failed my N twice and was super nervous for this one, but it was so easy. i had a great examiner too, really chill. \noverall i found it super easy, but i drive all the time in this area. i also drove around for like 2 hours the day before my test and an hour the day of before my appointment, which i found helpful! \n\ngood luck!!",
            "One of the easier places to take the road test IMO. I took it there and got it first try, my parents and relatives also took theirs at the MacDonald street location decades ago and they all got it their first try as well. Benefits of the MacDonald St. Location is that there aren't really any really challenging areas they can take you to, the highway portion of the exam is covered by Marine drive leading into UBC (that is if they even decide to test you on a highway portion), and Marine drive is easy to merge and change lanes and such. The hills in that area also aren't that steep and are manageable, unlike at other locations. I heard they have a set of a couple of road test routes that they pick at random for your test. \n\nAvoid Burnaby/Metrotown (too many hills, highway 1 is nasty), and Richmond (Richmond drivers can be unpredictable and that's an extra challenge you don't need), or North Vancouver (Again, too many hills). \n\nAnd as usual, better safe than sorry, when in doubt be extra dramatic and exaggerate your shoulder checks (if you braid your hair or wear a cap this helps with that), and go slower than the speed limit rather than faster. If you're slightly too slow you might get a comment for being too slow and lose a point or so, but too fast is automatic fail most of the time. Generally if they see you're a safe and confident driver they'll end early and pass you. When I took my class 5 last summer they ended mine on a residential street, told me to parallel park by the curb, turn off the car and get and that freaked me out cause I thought they were trying to fail me, until they mentioned it was because the OCBC center had no parking space left and congratulated me for passing.",
            "Following",
            "Leeching off this post, has anyone taken their drivers test with an evo? Would we be allowed to do that??",
            "Biggest tip for Point Grey is to find a driving instructor that is UPDATED with their routes. My first driving instructor was this old guy who took me through the same route over and over again. I did multiple lessons with him, but I didn't actually learn the area because all he did was take me through his own route (presumably the same route he's been teaching for 20 years). With the amount of construction in the area, you need someone who is UP TO DATE with all the signage and construction zones. \n\n\nI haven't driven in the Point Grey area in a while, but my understanding is that the W King Edward area is still totally fucked up from construction. The main issue is not the construction, it's the fact that the signage there is all temporary, which makes it harder to practice there, and sometimes the city does a shitty job with signage.\n\n\nHere are some pics of the intersection I failed my road test at (Sep 2023): https://imgur.com/a/q4qUhpS\n\n\nI was going east on King Edward, road test guy told me to turn right onto Blenheim. Traffic was diverted onto the other side of the median. At the intersection, my light (King Edward) turned green, so I proceeded to turn right onto Blenheim. Instructor slammed on the brakes -- there was a stop line INSIDE the intersection. I looked around for a stop sign, didn't see any. Instructor points at a sign ON GROUND LEVEL, passenger side, INSIDE the intersection. This sign was not visible to me as I was waiting at the light, only visible AFTER I turned into the intersection. I looked around to see why the stop line was there; couldn't find one. Because the other side of the median was fully blocked off, there was no through-traffic that would require the stop sign to be there. So I got fucked for no reason. (the pics above were taken on Blenheim, facing North). \n\n\nTwo weeks later I took my road test in Lansdowne, Richmond and passed with a [blank score sheet](https://i.imgur.com/ICJOMQA.jpeg) :D\n\n\nThe second driving instructor I found was super up to date with the ICBC test area, and took me through the entire Lansdowne ICBC zone in one 90 min session. He even sent me a pdf containing all the problematic areas and all the street signs I needed to look out for. Awesome guy, taught me the whole Lansdowne zone (which I was not familiar with previously) in one lesson.",
            "a good resource is youtube, if you search class 5 icbc routes, you may be able to find point grey on there.\n\nI looked at a few when I was about to do mine, I felt like the class 5 was so easy compared to the n test too.",
            "My road test instructor took me through both W King Edward AND the schools that were on that road 🤡\n\n\nAt one point, I slowed down to about 35-40 km/h because of the construction zones AND because there was a school right there. I thought I was supposed to slow down to 40 km/h because it was an active construction zone and there were workers on the street. I was also concerned because I saw a school directly to my right. Turns out, he wanted me to go 50 so he deducted a mark. \n\n\nHe told me: \"Why have you slowed down to 40? Did you see a sign that told you to slow down to 40? At the start of the test I told you to observe and obey all traffic signs on the route. Where did you see a sign that told you to slow down to 40?\" \n\n\nI asked a different instructor about this and he said 40 is fine. ??",
            "No, it says on the Evo website you can’t use an Evo for tests. I believe you can book a lesson with most local driving schools and use their car for the test immediately after."

Just keep in mind that while labs are generally considered “gpa boosters” that’s only true in the sense that the average of a lab course is higher than the average of a lecture course. The distribution is generally pretty tight, and it’s pretty much impossible to get >90 ish unless ur TA just doesn’t check ur work. \n\nThe grading schemes, at least in second year, remain fairly ambiguous especially given the turn around times on actually getting feedback…",

Some aren't though, so I would suggest asking any upper year Chem students their opinions on which labs to try to take and which to avoid like the plague.\n\nOf course if you see a topic that you're interested in go with your heart's desire.",
            "Chem 235 doing me no good either LOL",
            "Former Chem and Biochem TA for both UBC and UofT... \n\nThe problem with the first year labs that you're probably experiencing is that they're trying to cram more in than they're talking about. Sure, the labs are for lab technique, but they're also used to teach basic calculations, error propagation, conservation laws, writing skills, etc. Those things are easier to mark because they can be handed in, even though they feel secondary to all the time you spend in the lab. \n\nFeelings about not knowing what the marker wants is partially due to the course design but primarily due to bad communications from the TA (assuming the TA is marking). I would suggest sitting your TA down and get them to communicate to you what the expectations are and where, in previous assignments, you've missed the marks. If you approach this conversation as an opportunity to learn as supposed to a chance to fight for marks, you're more likely to learn something, do better for the rest of the term, AND are more likely to actually get marks back. \n\nIn second year, things get a bit better because things start becoming routine. The hand-ion assignments are the same each week. The rubric is the same each week. What changes is the chemistry. At this point we assume you've learnt the basics so we can focus more on chemistry and communication (a touch ironically). \n\nAnd in third year, that's where it really gets fun. I remember one organic lab being \"Make compound B from compound A. You have everything in the lab and 4hrs. Hint: you might want to use a balloon and maybe some string. Also, a good luck charm.\" At that point, it's entirely up to you to find a plan the week before, test the plan, and communicate the plan and the results. The rubric for that one only had 1/20 allocated for actually being able to make the compound. \n\nChemistry labs can be fun. But they can also be infuriating if something just isn't clicking, either with the chemistry or the communication. It gets better. Or, at least you might eventually get a better TA. \n\n\np.s. the string was a red herring.",

        "selftext": " Hi kids,\n\nLooking for a last-minute Valentine’s day gift for your romantic partner? Head on over to [UBC’s sex shop](https://students.ubc.ca/health/wellness-centre/wellness-centre-sexual-health-shop) (aka the Wellness Centre). It is open from 11:00am to 4:00pm Mon-Fri. \n\nI have previously shared some posts on the sex shop (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/10xfyjl/go_check_out_ubcs_sex_shop_it_is_cheap_actually/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/16gg1mo/new_students_did_you_know_that_there_is_an/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/18isqlm/dont_have_time_to_go_to_the_mall_and_get_a_gift/)) and this will be my last post of the school year in conjunction with Valentine’s Day. \n\nThe Wellness Centre carries a variety of products, from traditional dildos and vibrators to male masturbation sleeves, lubricant, butt plugs, and condoms. They also carry reusable menstrual products for the female body. I want EVERYONE to know about its existence. I think that it’s great that they offer an array of products at such accessible price points - and purchasing is not limited to students. \n\nThe Wellness Centre carries a variety of products from traditional dildos and vibrators, to male masturbation sleeves, lubricant, butt plugs, and condoms. They also carry reusable menstrual products for the female body. \n\nThis is going to be the most descriptive review, so if you are not interested in reading something that will make you feel like you are having a hot flash, I would exit now. \n\n\\-----------------------------\n\n**Products mentioned:** Mega Dildo Vibrator *($32)*, Slippery Stuff gel lube *($5/$9)*, and Wicked Simply Aqua *($12)*\n\nI think that I found my new favourite vibrating sex toy. I absolutely love this thing. \n\nThis morning, I visited r/gonewildaudio, found some erotic audio that suited my mood, lubed up this dildo with some Slippery Stuff lube (also from the sex shop), and tried it out. \n\nI absolutely love how *full* I feel. It doesn’t stretch me out in a painful way, but it makes me feel full in a way that my other dildos don’t. It is also smooth – like I don’t have the words for how pleasant it feels going in and out of me smooth. \n\nThe “handle” at the bottom is perfect to grip and pump it in and out of my vagina. Taking it completely out only to enter again feels AMAZING. \n\nThis dildo is good with and without vibration. What I like most about this is that the vibrations aren’t deep and rumbly but more delicate. I am concerned about desensitizing my clit, and I try not to use vibration as much as I used to (I am fairly certain that I damaged it with a poorly designed Lelo rabbit-style vibrator, but that is not a story for today). I like this delicate vibration, and this is going to replace some of the other toys that I have. \n\nAfter a bit, I added the Wicked Simply Aqua Lube. I liked how this lubricant felt way more than the Slippery Stuff Gel, but my vagina immediately started to sting a bit and I became uncomfortable. The texture of the Wicked Simply Aqua lube and this dildo was amazing. It was slippery, and wet – but I know I have a sensitive vagina, and my body had a near-instant reaction telling me that it wasn’t for me. \n\nAfter orgasming, I inserted a boric acid suppository into my vagina (purchased over the counter from the pharmacy by the McDonald’s), and my vag has calmed down. The Wicked bottle said that it is just a basic water-based lube, but also mentions olive oil extracts. I definitely won’t be using that lube again and wish that I bought a sample size to test instead of the entire bottle. \n\nIf you are a male using that lube with a masturbation sleeve, you should be fine. You don’t have to worry about upsetting the pH balance outside of your penis in the same way that women have to worry about the pH of their vaginal canals. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading. \n\nHopefully this post will motivate some of you to visit the sex shop for the first time. \n\nIf you want to go into the sex shop informed, you can view a list of their products [here](https://students.ubc.ca/sites/students.ubc.ca/files/sexual_health_shop_feb_2024.pdf). \n\nGoogle for some reviews of the various products. There are definitely reviews out there for the male masturbation sleeves. \n\nIn September I will review some of the aisle period products. Right now I have mixed feelings, but think I should try them for a couple of months, and perhaps try a variety before I completely write them off. I won’t be trying the period cups. I am a period disc type of woman. I also have an IUD and my periods are so light that I can get away with not using period products in everyday life (swimming pools are an obvious exception). \n\nHappy Valentine's Day lovers and friends :)",

You bring up good points for OP to consider, but I still think it's something they're going to have to figure out for themselves. You also can't really get meds before you talk to a doctor, so I think OP should be okay on that front.\n\nAnd just in case this is worrying you: I don't think you're a bad person, nor that you meant to attack OP or people taking ADHD medication.

That includes maintenance staff entering housing units without notification and walking in on residents while they are showering, sleeping, or when they are not clothed, causing a lot of distress.

They were very accommodating during COVID (too lenient IMO, many people gamed the “mental health” system).\n\nWhat most people don’t realize is the hardships you’re facing in work-life balance and mental health are because of university’s competitive workload nowadays, not UBC as an institution. Students in competitive programs across top universities in Canada (and likely globally) all struggle similarly. More and more people are choosing to go to university, so the bar keeps going up and up.\n\nI imagine many people rating it a 1 will be in for a shock when they see how less accommodating the working world is.",

            "Courses that nitpick over citation style details are usually awful. In research prep courses or if you’re actually trying to publish I understand the importance.\n\nMost of my Profs understand that the point of their course is to teach key learning objectives, which does not include citation mastery. The point of citations in coursework most of the time is to make sure students aren’t plagiarizing, and of course they get some research experience in writing correctly formatted citations. But I would say about an 80% correct citation is deserving of no lost marks unless clearly stated in the syllabus that ‘mastering’ a specific citation style is the goal of the course. \n\nI am quite familiar with APA and believe I make few errors. The most complex it gets is Chapters in edited books, knowing when to use commas or periods around titles, publishers, and authors. In all honesty those are even more minute details than stuff like italicizing journal volume and not the issue which is easy to do. I’d be willing to bet the extremely small details often get lost even in academic publishing. \n\n**If anything you should look out for sentences that don’t have citations that should. People often under cite when in reality the concept they are talking about is in some way inspired and paraphrased from some reference material. This is the hardest to “objectively” mark since it’s often unclear what is held as common knowledge, if the student has an idea of their own, if it was copied vs paraphrased, vs lightly inspired by some reference text. I would argue this is the most important thing for students to get right, and it is often the least checked for or discussed problem.**\n\nIt’s easier to distract ourselves with much less meaningful tasks like the objectivity of italicization and 0.5” hanging indents.",
            "To be honest, unless it’s an upper level course in a specialization with a heavily favored citation style, I think the citation style ought to be fair play, so long as it’s consistent. That’s been the policy of most of my 100-200 level courses, barring any specific demands from the course syllabus.",
            "Let's just all agree that\n1) name-date citation styles are horrible and should all be binned, mostly because they break the flow of the text;\n2) the actual formatting of a citation doesn't matter as long as relevant info is easy to find, as exemplified by the fact that there are a myriad of styles; \n3) nit-picking the exact formatting of a reference is simply intellectually small and any TA who feels they're spending too much time marking formatting is missing the point; and \n4) none of this is related to learning in any meaningful way. \n\nThat said, I'm a personal fan of ACS, Nature, and Vancouver styles. They're sleek, unobtrusive, easy, and functionally the same thing.",
            "I think you should qualify this advice with the department or subject you TA in. I've taken 5 upper level PHIL courses and no one cared about this stuff to this extent. I was either told exactly how to cite but the rules were very simple (e.g. PHIL 331 required only in-text APA-style citations with no works cited list), or I was told to pick or adapt a style I was comfortable with so long as it was reasonably clear (e.g. PHIL 369).",
            "I highly recommend using a citation software such as Mendeley (what I use) or Zotero, which does the in-text references and Bibliography for you! Honestly it's been a lifesaver for me, especially when I was writing term papers and my undergrad thesis.",

            "big agree on focusing on what should have citations and doesn’t that more gets into academic misconduct territory though more than just losing 5% on your paper lol, it can be argued for sure that the specific focus on the nitpicky is a waste but have seen lots of esp lower level arts courses dedicate 10% of the rubric to just accuracy of citations incl the nitpicky bits so it’s just a bit of unfortunate reality",
            "This matches my experience as a PHIL student. Except for one prof who asked for Chicago nobody has cared about the citation style. They just want to see *what* you cited, it generally doesn’t matter how you cite it as long as it’s readable. The point of citations in philosophy is twofold:\n\n1) If you are making claims about what an author says, that has to be grounded in specific passages of the text. Citing makes sure you’re really drawing from the text and not making up something based on a vague gestalt idea of what the author believes.\n\n2) The marker needs to be able to check the citation to see whether it really supports the claim you’re making. This is also important when you make a wildly off-base claim — if they’re able to check the citation, they can see where your misinterpretation came from.",

            "I think the grade distributions would beg to differ. They are generally stingier with As than our home dept and often have lower averages. That said, I do find the workload of PHIL courses to be considerably lighter than CPSC courses. Also CPSC probably gets way more try-hards."

            "Not necessary. Busses to and from UBC are plentiful and while they can be delayed or late sometimes, they are generally ok.

            "if you can afford it (parking costs, insurance, gas, etc) then i think it would be a huge luxury to have one. obviously, you don't really need it since campus has everything you need nearby and the transit system is great here. but if you want to explore the city, go back to Northern BC frequently, or even make errands a lot easier, the convenience might be worth it to you. i did a ton of exploring in first year and a car would have significantly saved me time. it's totally dependent on your circumstances and how you envision using it! \n\nand congrats on the offer!",
            "Here is the thing: Everyone is right. Parking is expensive, gas is expensive, if you get a larger car it's hard to find a parking spot you fit in etc and honestly you dont really NEED a car at UBC. However, being from the north as well, I have been driving since I was little (farm kid) and was very used to the freedom of going whereever whenever. So when I moved to be at UBC and didnt have a car, I was struggling with having to take a bus, waiting for it etc. plus grocery shopping without a car was baaaad. Additionally, I really like exploring and hiking etc. and it can be hard to get out to nature in a decent amount of time by bus. Overall you have to ask yourself: is the price of having a car worth the comfort and will it significantly impact my life if I do-(nt) have a car.",
            "You def don't need one around campus. It's more do you want one for fun stuff like road trips or going hiking. So I'd say it depends on if you want to get to the great outdoors or if you want to hang around the city. If it's just the occasional trip use evo or rent a car.",
            "Vancouver has some great car-sharing services like Evo that you can use to travel around the city. Perfect for groceries, seeing friends, going to a game etc. It's a flat rate of 0.49$ per minute, you don't pay for gas, and you can park pretty much anywhere. So for the day-to-day, you really don't need a private vehicle out here. \n\nIt's more for weekend trips out of the city, and driving back up to see your family. I know lots of people that have a private vehicle for those types of trips, but use Evo for their weekly groceries etc. If you can keep the mileage down on your personal vehicle, you could be eligible for some p solid distance-based discounts on insurance.",
            "You don’t need one but I think it’ll improve your quality of life. For myself and others I talked to, not having a car meant basically being on campus all the time and feeling like ubc is your whole life. Vs now I live off campus w a car and it’s just my school, and I can have fun everyday in downtown or go to Costco or Walmart easily- without it’s like an hour bus",
            "Bruh, why not. If you got daddy’s money spend it while u can",
            "All these comments from people who never leave campus except to get groceries calling it a waste yet don't even get into the benefits of actually having one. Also, what's this chatter about how good the transit system is? It is terribly mediocre compared to many other big cities. Get the car and explore the city unabated, drive across the border, take it over the ferry and explore the island. Most of the people I know who don't have a car have never even been across Lions Gate Bridge or seen any of the beautiful cities surrounding Vancouver. There are so many possibilities and, since your dad has offered to buy you one, you won't need to rely on someone else's good will to drive you places. Ignore the people calling it a waste, it is his gift to you. Congrats on your offer!",
            "not worth it, especially if you live on campus. The buses around campus are amazing and free, getting around the city is pretty easy too. Gas prices are crazy in Vancouver (>$2.00) and don't get me started on the traffic. The one good thing is that you have the freedom to drive up to whistler and all that but even then there are buses that can take you there for cheap. On top of that parking on campus is not cheap. These are the reasons I'm trying to sell my car right now.",

Don't listen to anyone else and just go to St Paul's hospital, its the same amount of time to drive to get there as VGH and the wait times are 5 hours shorter.

            "Yeah, and its an anecdotal moment that matters now. Anyhow, stop spreading disinformation on the internet to try to win an argument. What matters is OP gets the care they need in a timely matter and the best way to do that is go to St Paul's right now. Its better to wait 3.5 hours in pain next to crackheads instead of 7.5 hours also next to crackheads. And for OP, I'm pretty sure their biggest concern is not gonna be whether they're gonna wait next to a crackhead but the fact that they're in severe pain and need treatment ASAP.",
            "FYI there are many crackheads at VGH. As someone who has been to the ER over 6 times in the last few years, I always look up the wait times to ensure I don't have to wait a long time and St paul's is always consistently 4-5 hours faster than VGH. The reason why I started doing this was because my first ER visit was at VGH and took over 7 hours with crackheads and I looked up the wait times while waiting and saw that St Paul's was again 4 hours shorter."

            "I would say math is harder at UBC, and that’s about it. Every other first year course was easier simply because IB is two years of content and UBC is 3 months. Anything that’s memorization based IB has wayy more content.",

Just the hustle and bustle of campus puts you in the right mood. I managed to finish last term with a pretty nice average so its definitely not over!\n\nAlso don't worry if you don't immediately start feeling better.

Honestly, I just try to get as much as sunlight/daylight as possible and combine it with walking, even just 10 mins. I feel much more refreshed.

            "I'd suggest putting your phone in a whole other room, I keep mine beside my coffee maker so that once I'm out of bed to get my phone I think \"might as well make my coffee\" then I sit on my couch and drink coffee and scroll for a bit.

You can also get a timed lock box to put your phone in or even switch a non smart phone for a while if you're really struggling with screen time. \n\nAlso, remember that we haven't seen the sun for months, which really decreases mood/motivation and makes life extra hard.

            "I find that planning out what you want yourself to do in the morning before going to bed helps a lot; not planning in your head, but actually write it down on a piece of paper and put it on your nightstand. Set an alarm, and when you wake up you will feel more inclined to follow through with your plan vs just having a voice in your head to be responsible for it. Emotions and thoughts can change when you wake up and feel tired but once its on a piece of paper, its on a piece of paper and you kinda have to do it (at least thats how I am now programmed so that it works for me).",
            "On the phone thing, get an app like Stay Focused or something similar. You can set yourself limits for screen time or specific apps. Make sure you put it on strict mode so you can't get around it. If having no access to your phone will simply make you procrastinate more on the computer, download Cold Turkey on the computer. \n\nThat won't solve the depression in itself, but it will at least force you to get off the phone, look around and maybe go out for a walk. It's the first step out.",
            "I’ve been through this several times. I’ve dealt with severe depression for like half my life, and although I found help through therapy, most of the effort has to come from you. A therapy just kind of holds your hand through it. The best thing you can do for yourself is to force yourself to get up and do something. It can be something small and then gradually increasing your productivity. For example, you could start with going out for a small walk or errand to get the energy and serotonin from exercise and being outdoors. I also found taking B12 has helped me be a bit more productive recently so maybe that’s worth looking into. But essentially the effort has to come from forcing yourself to do the things you don’t want to do. I wish you the best of luck and I hope things get better for you.",

We’ve been hearing the reports loud and clear and it seems that there’s a bunny hanging around Woodward IRC/UBC Hospital in need of rescuing, and we need your help!\n\nOur rescue efforts will span over the next week where we will lay down traps and treats for the bun, but we need the community’s help to help us keep an eye on the bunny so we know where to concentrate our rescue efforts. Since we’ve heard it hangs out in that general UBC hospital/Woodward IRC area, please use the comments of this post or the DMs of our instagram @ubcrabbitats as a ‘tip line’ to report any sightings of the bunny: where did you see it (be as precise as possible!), when you saw it, and any other relevant information.\n\nThroughout the January snow and rain, our satellite shelter suffered lots of damages from the weather which has greatly limited our rescue capacity as we’ve had to rebuild it. Considering our capacity is already restricted by our limited resources (we are a nonprofit, so our shelter facilities/vet and rehab bills all rely on donations) we unfortunately need to be quite selective with the bunnies we take in. But judging from how close this bunny has been getting to folks, as well as it’s breed (a Japanese harlequin to be precise!), we strongly suspect that this bunny is a recently dumped pet and we’re just as concerned about it as you are. Your support during this rescue mission would be a great help!\n\nWho knows, once we take it in and as it’s rehabilitating, we would love to open up a way for the UBC community to name it as a dedication to all the support you’ve shown our rescue 🙂\n\nTo help with this particular rescue mission, please keep your eyes peeled and report anything you see to us here or on instagram [(@ubcrabbitats](https://www.instagram.com/ubcrabbitats/)). We would also *greatly* appreciate any donations - if you have anything to spare please send them over to [this link](https://rabbitats.org/donate/) or you can also support us by hosting us for a Meet N’ Treat with your on-campus club at [this link](https://rabbitats.org/events/)!",

            "They have higher percentage of fees - especially on minimum - so I think the University and AMS excluded them from their payment systems. You can’t use Amex for tuition or housing payments either. Amex doesn’t make it easy for merchants to set up a system… on a lot of systems, visa and MasterCard are already programmed, but you have to go through a rigmarole to get Amex. When I set up payment systems in the past, I didn’t use Amex because of those reasons. But it would be nice to have Amex and get some points",

I would recommend emailing your advisor directly, cc’ing your instructor and the exam team to see how this can be addressed.

I would demand to speak to the exam team lead who you are in on the day of and tell them that this is not acceptable. Usually it’s fixed by the time you write your next exam.

            "I have a bubble tea addiction, and I live on campus. This is my opinion of the ones I have tried. \n\nChatime 6.5/10: i like their drinks but the new management skimps on pearls. 2 scoops of pearls at chatime is usually less than 1 scoop of pearls at other locations on campus. Definitely the most expensive bubble tea on campus as well. I only come here if i’m desperate because of the pearl portion problem. \n\nTeadot 7.2/10: I really like their dragon slush drinks and I think they give an appropriate amount of toppings, but could be more generous. My issue with Teadot is usually their employees. Several times i’ve dealt with rude workers or they don’t blend my slush enough and I end up with giant ice chunks in my drink. \n\nPearl fever 8.5/10: Pearl fever lacks quality but it stills tastes quite good. Pearl fever is my go-to bubble tea spot on campus. They have a reward program too so I get a lot of free drinks. They’re very generous with their toppings and despite the cheapness of ingredients it still tastes quite good. \n\n101 Boba 7/10: overpriced toppings, while occasionally skimping as well. One of the most expensive places to get boba on campus. I like their mini pearls though and their drinks taste quite good. \n\nSharetea 5/10: Drinks taste mid and are expensive. Customer service is also quite mid usually. \n\nBengong’s tea 7/10: It’s good but the drinks are more complex, so if that’s something you like then it’s perfect for you. I haven’t been here too many times but customer service hasn’t been that great. The drinks taste good too but could taste better in my opinion.",

The milk/cream does tend to overshadow the actual tea flavour though. I do actually think that their pearls are some of the best on campus at the moment\n\nTeadot: 6, pearls are usually stiff, tea flavour is really light, pricing tends to be a bit high from memory. I could be wrong on that last note, but I do remember feeling that the cost was not worth it\n\nPearl Fever (standalone): 8.5, haven’t been disappointed by this place yet. Pearls are soft but still have nice chew, tea flavour is quite strong, and pricing is pretty reasonable.\n\nPearl Fever (Ike’s): 7, same as the standalone location but with a far more limited selection. The pearls are also stiffer, though I can understand this given the storage constraints\n\nBubble Waffle Cafe: 6.5, tea tastes like powder. They probably use a powder tea mix or creamer. Pearls are mushy. Price seems about average. It’s fine if you need boba and can’t be assed to walk across campus.\n\n101: 8, pearls are on the tougher side (not necessarily bad), tea flavour is quite strong. Iirc the pricing is on the higher end. \n\nHave not tried Bengong or Hero. Hero because I have never heard of it, and Bengong because I have opted to save a bit of money and go to Pearl Fever every time",

It's like a cycle, I'm feeling too anxious to start yet too anxious by starting. Just know there's always an end at the tunnel, don't harm yourself and contact mental health services. There's so many solutions and answers out there that you just can't see right now, you can always take a break and leave for a term. Email profs and get concessions etc. Don't let this smal bump affect your whole car ride u know. I got through because of my supportive friends and parents, I hope you also have a supportive system that you can talk to for this because it helped me so much. If nothing else, my dms are always open if u wanna talk :)",
            "Hi love, breathe. 🪷 Are you registered with CFA? If so then reach out to an advisor/ go to drop ins and they can contact your prof and do a concession so you can focus on your health. If you’re not registered with CFA, then I’m more than happy to explain how the registration process works and you’re welcome to dm me. I strongly recommend registering with CFA.\n\nI’ve been at the same place as you with my mental health and it’s really hard - I get it. You’re not alone in this and there is help & support. \n\nDo you have any mental health supports currently / diagnosis? That would be helpful so you can get through this time.\n\n\nHowever for now, if you’re not registered with CFA I’d recommend calling counselling asap when they open this morning & booking a drop in apt. You can tell them exactly what you wrote here and they can help guide you on what to do & also offer further resources for mental health aside from academics. You could also connect with your faculty advising and explain things & request for a concession however from my experience sometimes some advisors are nice and others are not so well versed in mental health matters.\n\nYou could also send an email to your prof about what’s going on (you can just say you’re experiencing a health flare up rather than specifying mental health if that feels better). You can ask to meet over office hours to discuss options & if need be you can ask a drop in doctor to write a medical note stating your health impeding the exams. \n\n\n💙🩵Sending you hugs and don’t be hard on yourself. Life’s tough but you don’t have to go through it alone. 💙🩵",

            "Hey, I've experienced a lot of similar struggles and feelings all throughout university. I've been here since 2018 and this is my final semester. Things are finally looking less dark for me, but I have a lot of awful days still - including last night.\n\nThe single biggest paradigm shift for me personally was the choice to try to get better, when I had internalized that I don't deserve to. And I still often feel that way, but if I'm going to be in this world for the long haul, I have to make the best of it.\n\nIt may seem like generic advice to reach out to wellness and health resources at UBC. But I've been doing that over the last few months, and for all the ways it can feel \"too late\", it's made a big difference. Even just the psychological change of feeling like I'm on a positive journey now. It never felt possible.\n\nI really wish you the best.",
            "Hey there, OP. Firstly, I want to applaud you for recognizing your feelings and to talk about it. My advice is - don’t take the midterm, and instead apply for an academic concession. Talk to an advisor and your prof (if comfortable).\n\nI want to emphasize that taking care of your mental health should be your first priority here. Don’t be too hard on yourself here. I know what it feels like to not be able to get up, as when I was in second year, I burnt out and during one week I could not get up. Getting yourself help is crucial. If you do get counselling and you are with the Pacific Blue cross, you will get reimburse 80% of what you pay. If you do feel suicidal, you can call 988 (suicide crisis line in BC). Please know that you’re not alone in your situation and that you deserve the help you need. \n\nStay strong there, OP. Keep your head up. My DMS are also open if you would like someone to chat with.",

I feel like no matter what effort I put in, I will always fall behind. Moreover, I fear that I will not be able to survive at the upper level since I didn't even excel at this time.

            "I spent 11 years to finally get a degree.\n\nI graduated High school in 2013, and for 4 years, I was constantly switching majors just to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nUniversity is a time in your life to try new things, fail at many things, and learn from those failures. Take initiatives in leadership roles. Those failures have little consequences. That is the point of your university experience: to build character.\n\nI went from Engineering, to World Literature, to Chemistry, and then finally decided to settle for Statistics at UBC. But my Statistics degree took another 7 years. Through lots of ups and downs and developing health issues, I still finished my degree and work in Data Engineering.\n\nAnd so what if I finished at a later age? It is said that the average person switches careers about 4-5 times throughout their life.\n\nYour gpa will not matter later on in your life. Nobody ever asks for those things. They care about the people you have worked with, the projects you have done. And finally, they will care if you have integrity.\n\nIntegrity is the most important thing. Be a person with good morals. You can go to a great school, but if you have no integrity, then you lose everything.\n\nLook at Sam Bankman, after he was caught, everyone else associated with him also fell down too. His parents, friends all got in trouble. Sam went to MIT, his friends are all from MIT, Harvard, etc. His parents are also Harvard professors.",

However, I have to wait till May for my graduation.\n\nFor students like me, there are several problems we encounter straight out of college:\n1. We pay the Athletics and Recreation fee for the winter sem but our gym (Birdcoop + ARC) fee is hiked from $42.5 to $198 per term. We cannot play Intramurals too. Reason the AMS gives is we’re not enrolled in courses.\n2. No support on compass cards as our $80-90 payment per term stops and we have to pay atleast $104 a month to avail transit.\n3. Barely any support from career services.\n\n\nIn a lean month like January, it just feels like we have been left out in the cold especially because we’re job hunting in really tough circumstances. I’ve approached many college authorities but to no result. Worst is I know many others in the same boat.\n\n\nMy request is to the common student of UBC- take care of your fellow grads and look out for them. Support them in these few months. We’re here to be together. Let’s show compassion because we’re all incredibly privileged to study at an institution like UBC. Thanks and regards.",

Get your support while you are a student and after you need to support yourself",

But if you don't like the fact that the Birdcoop gets more expensive, you can simply not pay and actually save $40. Surely this is a bonus in 'these lean months'. \n\nTo the second point: you don't get the benefits of the UPass while you're not a student. This is obvious and complaining about it is like complaining about not being able to pay high-school student fare. \n\nTo the third: you're not saying enough to really rebut this. It's a hard time to be looking for work. Career services aren't magical. Do you have a good network? Relevant experience? They can't help with any of that, and they're the most important parts. They can help you put together a good resume and help you prepare for interviews. \n\nYou decided to get a Master's. (Hopefully not as an international student as being an international student with a Master's from Canada is widely regarded as being a red flag by employers unless the program is well-regarded in the field.) You knew the risks going in, and for once, neither the AMS or university is at fault.",

Salute when we pass one by? Give you their seat on the bus? like what?",

These fees for keeping privileges open are short change compared to the tuition we pay in any case. If you ever are in a position like this (hope you aren’t), you’ll understand what I meant.",

Sometimes things aren’t fair and at the end of the day UBC is gonna win. But I agree a $200 gym membership is bs. Sometimes things aren’t fair and that’s just how it be. Do i think grocery prices and my rent is fair? No but I have to pay it to get by. That’s part of the cost of going to this school and living in Vancouver.

I was in the varsity team for a racket sport, and they allowed me access to the sport facility and gym at university rates for a year after I graduated.

Certainly most of what you said is nonsense, which is why I assume you only responded to instead the one thing I actually agreed was a little odd - you conveniently forgot about that, though. \n\nAs a side note, there's nothing inefficient about this system. There isn't waste, just the university getting money out of you which you don't feel they should be taking. If it was slow or arduous, that would be inefficient. Perhaps you meant to say that you feel cheated or taken advantage of? That you think it's unfair?\n\nWhat did enrollment services admit? Do you have anything on the record? Talking to the AMS to see if they can advocate for change is probably a good idea. \n\nIn any case, I don't expect a response - it's a little weird that you assume I do? If you want to respond, go right ahead, I guess. It doesn't really matter to me. That said, you're doing a poor job of \"not even going to start arguing with me\".

This is perhaps indicative of you being too invested in the opinions of strangers on the internet. That's never a good idea. \n\nRegardless, I'm certainly not going to shut up on your say-so, not least because this post and your comments don't give me any confidence that you're capable of making good choices in your own life.

I understand that the student is only using one of the two semesters because they finished the requirements early. But they knew ahead of time that the fees are per academic year.\n\nI understand the hardship because I didn't take any courses in fall semester, but then got charged the yearly dues anyways in Jan for the second semester because I decided to register, but I understand that as a me problem not the university's.\n\nThe only reason I say that is because the standard is the full two semesters. It would be more cost efficient to break down the fees into half and then charge per semester, then the student would be good, but the school has to budget to pay their staff to be available for the full year, as their semester contracts cannot changed as easily is students decide to not take semester courses and vice versa.  Hired staff cannot be reduced due to lower demand in second semester as easily, as potentially they must be prepared.",

Look at the program requirements or ask your program advisor as they may also restrict how many you can take at once. If the Directed Studies courses are the same course code, you can also look at the UBC calendar to see how many credits you can take. It will say something like (3/6 or 3-6) which means that it is usually run as a 3-credit course and you can take it more than once up to 6 credits.

These types are questions are best answered using the start approach (S situation, t task, a actions you took, r results, t take aways from the experience).

This isn't casting aspersions on the students. They are trying and work hard, but cultivating the judegement to work independently is why research experience is so valued, but also time intensive to develop in a new student/employee/volunteer. Since my research lab is largely judged on research results, I have to be judicious in making the choice on if to do the research myself or invest the time in a trainee.\n\n\nTaking on research students is made 'worth it' in one of three ways: \n1) longevity, ie an undergrad being paid by a summer USRA then doing an honors thesis, or a grad student in the lab for 2-4 years: \n\n\n2) taking on a small number of registered students is a 'value added' part of my job (which goes away if your not registered).\n\n\n3) the research has project has been carefully designed to make use of 'low training' labour (Designing these projects is a difficult skill to master and not possible for all fields) "

During this time, I encountered a tons of problems and headaches with my landlord and housemates, including but not limited to, noise issue, conflict in using kitchen (too many ppl wants to use kitchen at a time), wifi connectivity (I told my landlord that the connection is so poor but she never fixed it), and something else. After that, I refrained from renting a place with random roommates, because I’m too tired and don’t want to deal with these issues again ever.\n\nWhy do you have only two classes, and what if you miss the midterm exam or final?\nI’m in fifth year, and graduating in May this year. The both of these two classes requires in person attendance and they are my degree requirements, for being a research intensive course, there is no alternative format which the classes are conducted. I don’t have anything like in person midterm or final exam for either of these two courses, as I will just need to submit papers for any assessment, which offers lots of flexibility on that.\n\nThe time wasting at airport even longer than the flight itself take? Then why do you say it’s quick and easy?\nCalgary airport (YYC) is not as crazy and busy as Pearson, the on-time performance is pretty good unless there is extreme weather or delay of incoming flight. I didn’t encounter a single delay for all flights since January. I also have nexus card which allowed me to use the faster lane usually no one is in the line, so I could get thru the security two minutes after I stepped into the terminal. So I usually get to the airport right at or 10 minutes before boarding time, and I’ve never encounter a single issue with that. I also don’t have any checked or carry on luggage, just a backpack with my laptop and iPad, so it’s also out of my concerns. So generally my time spent at the airport in Calgary wont be longer than 20 minutes.\n\nDo you think your dedication would bring you somewhere that offers you a great job?\nThough I don’t know to say yes or no to this question, but I’m working hard toward this goal, same as many other students. The most important thing is, it sounds even worse to me if there is no dedication is shown, that means there’s no way for me to approach any opportunities. I also do my internship in bankings and consultings, which i have done four since my second year, just as other students who are also working hard.",

The flight land in Vancouver usually at 12-12:15, and I could get to the campus mostly around 1:10. My classes are 2-5. After class I’ll head to airport, either via 49 or R4 and skytrain. Typically get to airport at 6:10-6:20. My flight way back departs at 7 and board at 6:25, and for having nexus, it means security only takes me a minute or two. Then I’ll go straight to the gate but most of time I got 10 to 20 minutes to spare in the terminal. I arrive in Calgary mostly 9:20 and will got home by 9:40 or 9:50. And that’s my day~",

            "That sounds about right. Think about it this way, only the 80-100 students from 220 can move on to 320. However the curve still needs to stay the same... Obviously they can't allow a 90 average in 320. So basically the 80 becomes the new ~50.",

            "This isn't true.

I'm sure the same has occurred for MATH 320.\n\nStudents can do poorly in courses for a variety of reasons: depression, undiagnosed learning disabilities, overcommitting, getting hit by the truck that is life, or just being plain bad at school or tests. Grades are some indicator of future success, sure, but they're not a very good or consistent one. I think it's better to give students appropriate preparation than rely on getting a certain percentage in prereqs that don't adequately prepare you.",

PMath 333, the intro third year analysis course (which you can skip if you took the advanced calc courses) covers most of 320 and 321 combined (except in the setting of normed vector spaces, not metric spaces), and the only prerequisites are *60%* in linalg 2 and calc 3. The intro proofs class (math 135/145, you take it as soon as you arrive) is implicitly a prereq since you do it before linalg 1, but your grade is 0 factor in if you can take real analysis 1.\n\nIf you did the advanced calc courses, you go straight to 351 at the end of your second year, which covers what's in 320 and 321 that hasn't been covered so far, as well as the start of 422 *and* extra content. So at waterloo, even if you don't follow the \"advanced\" sequence, on the same course pace as UBC, you still cover about two months more content, and the accelerated sequence puts you far ahead. \n\nThe course averages in these courses at Waterloo are also much higher -- usually about 80% -- with pretty low fail rates. I can't speak to all the reasons, but first of all, even the easier calc 1 that math majors do at Waterloo covers epsilon-delta proofs, basic theorems about the real line, and generally follows a more mathematical \"style\", same with our calc 2 and 3, and especially linalg 2. The students saw proofs introduced at the start of their first year, then got several more semesters of practice before taking real analysis. If you do the advanced sequence, you've seen most of 320 and 321 by the end of your first year, in an environment with massive amounts of lecturer and TA support. Big focus on collaborative work and many resources available. \n\nUBC, on the other hand, has a bullshit calc sequence that's built for engineers. You don't do proofs until your second year (????), and the linear algebra courses seem super computational, not abstract or the way a mathematician thinks about it. From what I've heard, math is a grossly underfunded department given how many students it teaches (much less of a problem at waterloo, where it's a wholeass faculty), and there seems to be much more of a focus on research than teaching. The problem here isn't that math 320 is so hard -- the problem is that students aren't being prepared properly for or supported through real analysis, and so grade requirements are put in place. The analysis courses here aren't unusually hard, they're unusually easy and students do poorly, despite being strong. Talking like there's no way UBC could do this better is letting the university off the hook for what is, quite frankly, horrifying treatment of students.",

The preliminary admission criteria for grad school is 100% national exam, they don't care about your gpa.

UBC's MATH 303 can thus cover continuous time Markov Chains, more than what UW's STAT 333 covers.\n\nSome of what I learned in UW's STAT 850 was covered in UBC's STAT 305.",
            "I am in the boat of having overloaded myself second year and subsequently having done poorly in 220. I didn't take 226, so 320 is off the table, but I'm planning on taking 322 my fourth and final year via the 310 route. So it looks like I will be able to take group/ring theory and basic real analysis and graph theory before I graduate - but no Galois theory, no commutative algebra, no topology (point-set or algebraic), no differential geometry, no advanced number theory or advanced linear algebra. I'll have to contend with group theory's 60% average and 40% drop/fail rate (and ring theory's similar average and 81% high) but it should be manageable given that, you know, you get better at mathematical proof over time.\n\nI've gotten quite a lot out of my minor and the other parts of my degree but have felt like the mathematics part has been lacking: I feel like I'll be graduating without an undergraduate mathematics education, really. When I look at other schools, they seem to have breadth requirements requiring all of analysis/algebra/topology (and occasionally depth requirements requiring a more advanced dive into one of those), and their minimum requirements to take those classes seem to be universally at about 60% in the prerequisites. It's not like students at other universities are being taught a lite version of these subjects - but they're confident in their students enough that they don't feel the need to require a higher minimum grade than that (except maybe algebraic topology, not a lot of schools teach that: but only like six undergrads take it here each year anyway). This speaks to other universities having a better approach to pedagogy, I think.\n\nIt does feel like if you fuck up early on - because you're learning how to do math - you're pretty much screwed. And the sheer amount of calculus we do means our first year is wasted, and you don't get the opportunity to *really* fuck up until second or third year. And people hit 320/322, bounce off, and fail, because they haven't been given an appropriate mathematical background in an environment with student support. I have heard of /u/liorsilberman 's efforts to offer 320/322 as second year courses and 220/221/223 as first year courses which seems like it would alleviate the mess that must happen when people fail 320 in their third year.

            "Sure! But stat 240 covers measure theory (something no 300 level stats course does at UBC afaik), and stat 241 also does a reasonable amount of extra content, depending on prof. Keep in mind as well that EVERY math student at Waterloo needs to do 230/231 so they’re meant for a generalized audience (but still mathematical) audience. They’re also two of the least popular courses lol. Stat  240-241 are the more specialized ones. A course you aim at stat majors (240/241) is obviously going to cover more than a course geared so that math majors can learn some basic stats (230/231), and a 2nd year course will cover less than a third year course. Either compare 305 to 330, or to 240, not to 230 — they’re totally different courses. \n\nNo idea what’s going on at the graduate level in STAT — but I will say the UWaterloo graduate level PMATH courses I took were mostly harder than the UBC courses, but there’s always some stuff I see covers that wasn’t done at Waterloo and vice versa. It’s definitely weird that 850 was rehashing material you knew from a 3rd year class. I don’t know enough about uwaterloo stats past second year to know why that is. Could be that stats courses are less in depth, could be that Waterloo stats does stuff in a different order, could be something totally different.",

I was at that meeting, and even my proposal that honours students be exempted from this was voted down.",
            "I have some (strong) opinions on what would be an improvement myself:\n\n* MATH 120/121 should be required for all prospective honours math majors regardless of AP Calc credit. These are excellent, well-taught courses with considerable student support and are a fantastic, appropriately difficult introduction to mathematical proof... and nobody takes them because you can skip them with AP Calc, and then you get the MATH 320 failure rate / third year weeding.\n* MATH 220 should be a first year course and required for all math majors. It should be credit excluded with MATH 120/121. The idea is that strong students take MATH 120, and students needing a gentler introduction take MATH 100 + MATH 220 (but notably both by the end of first year!).\n* MATH 221 and 223 should be first year courses. The content is self-contained.\n* There should be an option to drop from 120 to 100 or from 223 to 221 at any point in the semester. These courses cover *content* at a similar pace that this is doable - the difference being that 223 and 120 are fully rigourous. For students (mostly engineers) who realize they don't like abstract math too late (it can take more than one pset to realize this: I had some friends in 120 who dearly regretted not dropping it when they could), this offers an easy out before declaring a major.\n* MATH 320/321 and 322/323 should be second year courses. The calculus prerequisite is counterproductive and should be removed - it serves to delay taking of these courses which makes it much harder to recover should one fail and does not prepare students regardless. Either MATH 121 or MATH 220 + MATH 100 should be the only prerequisite. \n* MATH 226/227 should be for math majors. MATH 200/317 should be for engineers. These courses are of similar difficulty - depending on who's teaching 200/317, 226/227 can be easier. There is no reason 226/227 should be for honours.\n* MATH 217 should be required for honours math instead of 226/227 or 200/317.\n* MATH 310 should be a second year course. This gives students that do poorly in 220 / drop 223 an opportunity to recover and take 322 third year, and then 400 level courses fourth year. \n* I have some thoughts on MATH 322/323 pedagogy based on an overwhelming number of secondhand opinions I've been privy to, but it's not anything I would like to express online, and is not particularly important in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIt's a lot of changes, but I think the MATH major needs a lot of changes. The people that UBC math is successful for end up following something similar to this anyway - skipping 100/120, taking 223/226/227 first year, taking 320/322 second and third year (both in the same year is commonly considered a bad idea), and then higher level courses fourth year. But that's only suitable for students with previous exposure to proof (uncommon): or for people that just go really hard first year. Why not structure the curriculum to set all students up for success?",
            "it was a failed attempt at a proof by contradiction",
            "The key phrase in this comment is \"faculty of mathematics\".  At UBC we don't have a whole faculty of mathematics -- we just have a department.  This means most students don't come in as math students.\n\nThe ones who come in intending to do math should take MATH 120/121 in first year (or 226/227 if they have AP credits, and in theory 320 directly if they can convince me they are ready for it).",
            "Yeah, the only issue though is that UBC's honours math courses are inconsistent. However, I think Waterloo might have that problem as well.\n\nIf you look at a MATH 120 exam from 2009, it looks no different from a MATH 100 exam. But MATH 120 from 2015-2019 was much closer to 319 than MATH 100  when Zahl taught it. In fact, it got so much in 2019 that half the class dropped, and the students formally complained to the math department about this.\n\nMATH 226 can either be even easier than 200 or quite hard depending on the prof.\n\nI think another difference is that UW has its own math faculty. At UBC, comp sci majors only need to take a stat course that combines STAT 200 and 302, rather than have to take, say, both STAT 200 and 302, as well as other random math courses. If someone is in Arts CS, the non-Arts electives are so restricted that they take fewer math/stat courses. However, it gets even weirder when they can say, double major/minor in math or stats in Arts and reduce the Arts minimum a lot.\n\nHonestly, there would likely be insufficient demand for an advanced version of MATH/STAT 302. Hell, they should just combine these courses.\n\nAt UW, some courses go in depth, but others like STAT 334 cram multiple classes (230+333+Brownian motion) in one like what MATH 217 at UBC does with 200+317.",
            "Thank you and the math department for voting against the breadth requirement! I’m glad there’s at least was at least some pushback against it.",
            "Your comments and suggestions have been noted. so thank you, and they will be forwarded to the Undergraduate  Chair. \n\nOn your 4th bullet point, it is already possible to change form MATH 120 to 100 or 223 to 221 during the term.  We have a special agreement with the Science Dean's office to approve such changes even quite late in the course.",
            "Excellent points.  As you can guess we've thought about these issues too.  My thoughts follow (as usual these are my personal thoughts; I do not purport to represent any other colleague or the department as an organization).\n\n1. \"MATH 120/121 should be required for all prospective honours\" -- I disagree.  Students enter the faculty of science at first, and only apply for specialization at the end of first year, and many don't even know what university-level mathematics is, let alone that they want to specialize in it.  Having a course registration decision in the summer *before* coming to UBC forever bar someone from the honours program would be unfair.  Thus students should be permitted to take MATH 100/101, figure out their mistake, and try to catch up into the honours stream.  That said, I completely agree we have a significant advising failure and should encourage more students to take MATH 120 rather than 100, and to have more students switch to MATH 120 in the first couple of weeks.\n2. \"MATH 220 should be a first year course and required for all math majors.\"  -- MATH 220 *is* required of all math majors.  It is not required of math honours students because it's better that they don't waste time with it and just take proof-based courses.  The calculus pre-requisite for MATH 220 isn't because any course content (years ago MATH 220 used to contain the proofs for MATH 100/101 but it has evolved away from that); rather the calculus pre-requisite is designed to ensure some level of mathematics experience.  My personal view is that you are right: we should just allow all students to take the course and have them sink or swim.\n3. \"MATH 221 and 223 should be first year courses.\" -- This has always been my view; I hope that these courses will indeed have 100-level numbers in the coming years.\n4. \"There should be an option to drop from 120 to 100 or from 223 to 221 at any point in the semester.\"  This is largely the case -- see Prof. Mac Lean's response.\n5. \"MATH 320/321 and 322/323 should be second year courses.\"  -- this is also my view; I usually phrase it as \"subtract 100 from all UBC MATH course numbers\".  In fact, there was a recent discussion on whether we should formally do that and literally change the numbers.  In the end I was persuaded that most students aren't ready to take the courses in second year.  However, I am actively working on an advising solution: having an official (and advertized) pathway to taking these courses in second year.\n6. \"MATH 226/227 should be for math majors. MATH 200/317 should be for engineers.\" and \"MATH 217 should be required for honours math\" -- the \"accelerated honours\" proposal included exactly the suggestion of replacing MATH 226/227 with 217.  My personal view is that either we have MATH 226/227 rigorous like MATH 223, with homework and exams focusing on proofs \\[which could be how it is now -- I don't know\\], or we should suggest that honours students take MATH 217 -- but I don't know exactly what is happening in these courses now (especially since all the course websites are now hidden in Canvas and there is no way to see them).  All that said, I don't think we should \\*require\\* students take any particular combination.\n7. \"MATH 310 should be a second year course.\" -- well, it is (if you remember to subtract 100 from the number) and in any case nothing stops anyone from taking MATH 310 in second year as long as they have taken MATH 221 already.  Note that MATH 223 contains nearly all of the material of MATH 310 so you can't take both for credit.\n8. \"the sheer amount of calculus we do\" -- I completely agree.  As written our first two years have *five* analysis courses (4 calculus, one ODE) and only one algebra course (linear algebra), and it would be much healthier to have less analysis and more algebra (and move topology to third year).   I agree with some colleagues who propose we have a second semester of lower-division linear algebra (which was the case decades ago, and which I proposed going back to in the reform that resulted in the old 322 getting split into 322 and 323; note that already have MATH 412).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding your last paragraph, the underlying issue is that we only have one fully rigorous course in the first two years: MATH 223.  I agree that we should \"set up more students for success\" by having more rigorous courses from the get-go, and that moving some of 320/321/322/323 to second year would help.  As a practical matter creating an organized pathway with this schedule while keeping the current schedule as the default is easier than making the relatively accelerated schedule the requirement and with the current schedule being a backup option.  It would be great if you are correct and most second-years can take 320 and learn as much as they would if they took it in third year.",
            "I would love to hear from you what about people that got into math as second choice? I got to math as a second choice from CS and I had low 80s average as first year. If I knew I would be doing math for my entire life I would take the honour direction (MATH 120/121).\n\nSo, basically I am fucked now being in math major? I couldn't even go to grad school now because most grad school requires analysis courses. Some might argue that you need to take honour if you want to go to grad. But let me tell you, a lot of math major from other univs are prepared to go to grad school.\n\nEven univs in my country (700ish QS world rank) requires analysis courses in 1st year. So, I can't even compete as mathematician in a 3rd world country that got degree in supposedly one of the best univ?\n\nUBC math department is a scam and only for honour math and people outside math major that take math courses as their requirements.",
            "I’m aware; I kind of think this is a structural failure (statistics, computer science and math should be unified and definitely not under science!). \n\nHowever, the rest of what I said still applies — there are far more proof based prerequisites for real analysis at Waterloo. As a result, it’s able to cover more content with students performing better. I’m aware that UBC math has an endless list of concerns and this isn’t high up on them — and I’ve also heard a ton of positive changes have been made (and that you’ve had a part in them!). My criticism isn’t an indictment of the people involved, since I know all of you work insanely hard, and in the confines of a system that severely limits your capabilities; instead I just wanted to highlight that, with sweeping structural changes, the course difficulty wouldn’t be issue, and I think the issue is at the foot of those structural problems.",
            "The way I write things misrepresents the procedure: faculty vote as individuals in those meetings, so it would have been more accurate to say that several individuals from math were at the meeting arguing against the proposal, but the majority of colleagues present voted otherwise.  Its also important to acknowledge they had reasons for their vote.",
            "Hi /u/liorsilberman and /u/marktmaclean !\n\nFirst, I'm really glad to hear that students are now able to drop from 120 -> 100 and 223 -> 221 any point in the term. I don't believe that was the case when I took it (2021W), and instituting something like that was probably the #1 piece of feedback my 120 group gave in the course evaluations (other feedback was: the course description was not sufficiently descriptive for high schoolers who do not know what rigour entails, the course was sorely lacking some sort of tutorial. we also all <3ed greg martin). It's quite nice and encouraging to see the department directly acting upon student feedback.\n\nThat in turn leads me to feel *more* strongly that MATH 120/121 should be required of all honours majors, possibly all math majors. They're well-taught courses: they could be fantastic introductions to mathematical proof. As they stand I think they need improvements - nothing major pedagogically but there is absolutely a lack of student support, given their status as first year courses. But, after talking this over with others: we also came to the same conclusion that a hard requirement is infeasible, particularly given transfer students and students entering mathematics from Science One. I and others have many thoughts on this that will make their way to the department hopefully soon, hopefully in a cohesive package.\n\nRegarding \"In the end I was persuaded that most students aren't ready to take the courses in second year\": I also don't think most students are ready to take the courses in the second year, for sure. I don't think most students are ready to take the courses in the *third* year. But the time in between the second and third year is not helping: 226 and 227 are not rigourous, it is probably impossible / not a good idea to teach them *as* rigourous before real analysis (I have heard bad things about universities that attempt to adopt Spivak's *Calculus on Manifolds* too early), the content is sparse enough to be collected into one course (already existing as 217), and so I think the emphasis should go on what else can act as preparation for 320/321. (322/323 are different beasts. again, I hope to bring detailed, collected, actionable feedback to the department soon, but the consensus among all I've talked to about that course is that it has been taught *exceptionally* poorly in almost every regard.) This absolutely ties into your point about only having one fully rigourous course before 320/322: I almost think it may be reasonable to ask students to take 120/121 before 320/321 even after having taken 100/101. The majority of people in 120/121 already know calculus from high school, so while I don't think it's fair to *assume* calculus for 120/121, I think it teaches material that is interesting and important to people who already know it and so could be taken after. Regardless, the current approach is unacceptable and sets students up for failure. (something approaching 50% of students who have already self-selected into mathematics failing/dropping *real analysis* is insane! the bimodality also speaks to that failure in preparation, i think.)\n\nRegarding moving topology to third year: this seems standard across other universities. I do not think this would work at UBC with the current content of 426. The course this year had 12 undergraduates, and taught approximately the content of two graduate level courses in one term of an undergraduate course. I know of three undergraduates who continued on to 427 (and one should really not count as an undergraduate). Topology is widely considered to be a foundational part of an undergraduate mathematics education, and that it is totally inaccessible to all but the *most* talented honours mathematics students is crazy (what is done with point-set in 320 does not count). I have not taken topology, nor will I be anywhere near being allowed to before I graduate, but some other students who have taken topology can and may possibly speak more to this soon.\n\n---\n\nI feel I didn't emphasize enough, however, reading back over my original list of suggestions, that these changes *cannot* just be confined to the honours mathematics major. The honours mathematics major is treated as the future graduate student path: they graduate with analysis, algebra, occasionally topology, and a smattering of fourth year courses in fields they are particularly interested in. There are serious problems with the honours track, that I've mostly already expressed above, but for all intents and purposes: this works. A few (shockingly few: [*six*, I believe](https://graduation.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2023/06/UBC_Congregation_Spring2023_WEB_R4.pdf), pure honours mathematics majors graduated last year) students graduate with the appropriate undergraduate education for further studies in graduate school. However: this is at the expense of literally every other mathematics student, who hit obstacle after obstacle when attempting to take further rigourous courses in mathematics. Plenty of these students could have succeeded. If they hadn't been shattered.\n\nThe regular mathematics major is thus treated as a wastebasket of a major. It does not produce mathematically literate students. How can it, with analysis and algebra the way they are? I think it is not only reasonable but imperative to have a first year curriculum that appropriately prepares *all* mathematics majors to take MATH 320 and 322 if they so desire: if not in the second year, at least by the third year. *Other universities do this.* Other universities do not have the insane rates of failure that UBC boasts. Why does UBC fall so flat in this regard? To this extent, I think that the existence of MATH 319 and the future existence of a 329 are actually counterproductive. These take up resources from an already broke, overworked (thanks, Calc I & II) department, where instead such focus could be put into making sure the jump from \"second\" to \"third\" year math is not a sheer cliff face, and thus enabling student success.\n\nEvery single mathematics student that I have talked to about this, honours or major, sans maybe one or two, have expressed some deep dissatisfaction with their degree. Whether it's the immense stress about whether they'll be allowed to take the courses they need for graduate school, whether they've been booted from the honours program after failing a course, whether they've fallen onto the course-dry majors track, or what have you, there is a shared *discontentment* with the way things currently are. \n\nI have also been asked to express some dismay with grade-based prerequisites. /u/blank_anonymous touched on it above, but the current system of prerequisites is really, for a lack of a better term, bullshit: that a passing grade does not constitute appropriate preparation for subsequent courses is a failure of pedagogy. If you do not get above a 68% in MATH 321, and want to go to grad school, *you're fucked*. All 400 level courses are permanently inaccessible. There's no retaking a passed course. It is exceptionally easy to trip and fall and get one bad grade - someone's entire degree / graduate school plans can be derailed due to one bad test. (Cutoffs are also a source of immense stress for students who *do* make them.) This applies too to other (all) grade-based prerequisites IMO. There is a deep sense of shame that comes with failing a class or failing to make a prerequisite: I think this acts as a silencing factor, driving students who would otherwise be able to identify distinct changes that could be made for the better to instead treat their failures as entirely a result of their own actions: but when stepping back to look at things overarchingly, *it is completely expected behavior*. I can't imagine this is good for anyone's mental health, to put it mildly.\n\nI will be graduating with a mathematics major next spring: a degree in mathematics. I will be graduating without an undergraduate education in mathematics. What is there to do? I can't ever see myself stopping learning mathematics, as it were. Something about it hooks you. But the mathematical education I will be graduating UBC with is not only less but significantly less than that were I at nearly any other institution. The OP (possibly) suggested it in jest, but straight-up enrolling in SFU or any other university for a year or two has been on my mind. But that's unaffordable and unachievable for students who could have simply gone to a different university and graduated with algebra and analysis, and much more. There are a substantial number of peers in the exact same boat I am (having done poorly in early prerequisites), and I have several other friends who had the option, grades, and passion to continue on with and be successful in honours mathematics but judged it to not be in their best interests. I want to ask, for them and for me: how can we best *finish* our degree?",
            "I largely agree with these points and u/omentic, I'll also throw in my anecdotal 2¢ as well. I'm a math+CS honours alumni who graduated last spring and am currently doing a PhD in computer science and logic. In my undergrad I was able to take 223 in my first year and 322/323 in my second. 323 was a bit much for me (my professor was excellent, but was teaching to a more mature audience) though I found 223/322 to be completely feasible. I think it's silly for that slightly accelerated schedule to be gated behind scores on high school exams, or exemption procedures which can be hard to navigate. \n\nI didn't end up using the 322/323 prerequisites for anything (I discovered in those classes that I do not enjoy algebra at all) however it was still extremely beneficial since it let me spread the work more evenly across my degree. Talking to my peers I get the impression that a normal student (myself included) can take maybe two or three honours math courses each term before they get overloaded. This means the \"standard\" honours path has space for maybe 4 or 5 specialized courses, all in the fourth year, and I think that having this be the default is a total waste. In my case I used my extra time to explore programming languages, without sacrificing from my math degree. My research these days depends on several of those upper-year courses-- I would not have been able to cram all the courses I use now into the default honours schedule and still be able to handle the pace.",
            "First, I would encourage even students intending to major in the CS to take 120/121 since these are much better courses.\n\nSecond, you can take MATH 223 and 226/227 even if you took MATH 100/101 in first year (in fact, that's what most of the students do).  If you do well in those courses you can continue to 320/etc in third year.\n\nThird, at UBC it doesn't matter what *program* you are in (math major / math honours) but what *courses* you take (you can take the \"honours\" courses regardless of what program you are in).  At UBC MATH the courses intended to prepare you for math graduate school are called \"honours courses\", but they are open to any student who has the pre-requisites -- you can be a \"math major\" or \"math honours\" student.   There may be an advising failure here -- we might need to be clearer that students who want to go to graduate school must take honours courses -- but I don't think it's wrong that, in addition to that, we also offer mathematics courses that are not at that level.\n\nYes, in most of the world something like MATH 320 is a required first year course of all MATH/PHYS/CS students.  Do you think that we should do this at UBC?  What proportion of MATH/PHYS/CS undergrads *could* pass 320 in first year in your opinion?  In truth most of the world has 3-year degrees, but even so -- do you think we could expect all MATH/PHYS/CS second years to take MATH 320?",
            "There is also another issue I did not bring up because I didn't think it was relevant, but the more I think about it, the more I realize it how much it really is: that of gender. [Between 50-70% of women drop out of honours mathematics. In stark contrast to around 30% of men.](https://firstyearmath.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gender-in-honours-mathematics.pdf) Almost everything in that slideshow (that must have been an interesting talk to be privy to) can be explained in the context of the current pedagogical system in place. Students are horrifyingly ill-prepared for \"third-year\" analysis/algebra. They band together to support each other, with friends they know from earlier. Whatever the reason - other shared interests, previous connections, unanalyzable societal factors - this group tends to be entirely men. A clique forms. Regardless of the composition of the clique, it is still a tight knit friend group - so hard to approach from the outside. So other students, namely women, do not find themselves with peers, and so find themselves with less support. Other schools (Waterloo notably) have pedagogical practices put in place to socialize students and provide connections in first year math to prevent this isolation.\n\nThe gate-keeping part of the presentation is also interesting: because that is simply a trickle-down from what the mathematics department transparently does. There are students who are Good, and students who are Not Good. If you don't get 80% in MATH XXX, you're not good enough for MATH YYY. Why wouldn't this approach to pedagogy affect the attitudes of its students? (the mathematics department's distinction between Good and Not Good is widely considered transparently obvious among undergraduate students. so is its consideration of grades as the sole delineating factor between Good and Not Good. to be blunt, this is soul-crushing. for all involved.)",
            "The ability to go from MATH 120/223/226 to MATH 100/221/200 has been around a long time (30+ years to my knowledge).  It would happen a few times per term for each of these course in my experience, perhaps most commonly in MATH 120 and 223.",
            "If this is the case, then there is a significant failure in communicating this to students. A number of my peers in MATH 120 were engineers: they expressed a sense of being \"trapped\" in 120 due to thinking the first homework assignment was a fluke, or that they'd get better at proofs faster than they did, and not withdrawing before the add/drop deadline. This led them to be immensely stressed and miserable throughout the term as their course load ramped up. I am aware of some people having done so in years before me but it was always expressed to me that they were able to do so by essentially begging the department, and that this was not a formalized system.",
            "It's always been available and the trigger is a request from a student, either to the instructor or the undergraduate chair."

I’m not diagnosed with any disabilities such as ADHD but I do find myself having trouble focusing with a short attention span. I have a year before my deadline so I’m not in a hurry to complete everything in one night. I was hoping to get a few tips and pointers from people who also suffer from  a short attention span and what helps you to stay focused?? (Vitamins, Medications, routines??) thank you!!!",
        "comments": [
            "Get rid of all distractions in your learning environment, especially your cell phone.\n\nTry to actively take notes/write down questions you may have. This prevents you from zoning out in class.\n\nPomodoro technique. Reward yourself with a 5 min break after 25 mins of studying, but don't get on Reels/TikTok cuz we all know how that will end up.\n\nDesignate a specific time of the day for studying, and plan out what you're going to do in that period. This gives you a goal to accomplish, so you'll tend to stay focused on it. For example, from 1pm-3pm after I eat lunch, I will read 40 pages of the textbook.\n\nTry out different methods and stick to them. \nGood luck!",
            "I second the note taking. It does the triple duty of helping you focus, pick out the important stuff AND have something to reference when studying",
            "I still struggle a lot with short attention span!! My advice is to set very small goals every day, goals that you would probably be able to meet with just 1 hr of dedicated study time. Even if you get distracted, don't let yourself end the day w/o accomplishing that goal (unless something important comes up)! If you think about it, you have 24 hours/day to finish that 1-hour goal!\n\nAnother strategy I use is, whenever i want to reward myself with a break, I go to the same \"source\" for a break. e.g. I like to watch dance videos, so I'll head to the same YouTube channel or playlist and just watch the next 1 or 2 videos as my \"break\". But this way, I avoid endless scrolling or random Internet journeys",
            "Try the Pomodoro Technique! Set a timer for 25 minutes of focused work, then 5 mins break. Repeat, and gradually lengthen focus times. Remove distractions, find a quiet spot, and use Noisli for background noise.",
            "Let your phone die, then go to the library and don't sit near an outlet. Decide what you want to do and don't leave until you've done it (bring a snack).",
            "Probably a good idea to talk to your family physician or any other primary care doctor to get this addressed, if this truly becomes an everyday thing you should get treated!",
            "Go to a library and listen to instrumental music always works for me :]",
            "You need to actually address the lack of attention beyond just when trying to study. What I mean is look at how your attention span is when not doing anything academic. Do you focus on a given task or are you constantly checking your phone and trying to multitask several different things at once? Just so you know, the human brain can't multitask. It can task switch quite rapidly so it feels like you're multitasking, but you're actually not. And what that means is that your focus is constantly being interrupted and hence your retention suffers. Do one thing, focus on it entirely and you'll be way better off than doing multiple things at once.  \n\nYou can try to apply all the hints and tips in the world to the time you're studying, but if your habitually distracted and trying to focus on multiple things in any given moment, that mindset will still be in place when you go to study. You need to train your brain to focus on only one thing. It's tough to be so mindful, but it's worth it.\n\nBut for a specific suggestion, here's what I do. Years ago I found a couple pieces of long, instrumental, ambient music, specifically said to increase cognition. Who knows if all the talk about alpha waves and binaural beats actually makes me study better, but every time I sit down to study, I put on the same music. I 100% feel that it works in a Pavlovian manner in that I hear that music, my brain knows it's study time."

Currently, transfer students make up 25% of all UBC students, yet there is a massive gap in tailored events and programs for these students. We want to change that and create engagement opportunities for our student community.  \n\nFor transfer students, it can be a struggle to find your network. As a new-to-UBC upper-year student, you're in a new environment where many people have already established their relationships, and setting out in the world of putting yourself out there can be daunting. Our club aims to be the social haven for new transfers, building a network of like-minded folks looking for community. \n\nHere's where you come in- we need 25 student signatures to be an official AMS club!  \n\nNow, why the AMS affiliation? Well, there are more than 15,000 transfer students at UBC. By partnering with AMS, the Transfer Student Club can access funding and event spaces, enabling us to reach our incredibly large audience and enhance our impact on the UBC community. The AMS affiliation will ensure that our club is well-integrated into UBC student life.\n\nReady to support the launch and be a part of a game-changing club? Sign our petition with your **name and student number**, and let's redefine the transfer student experience at UBC!\n\nHere is the survey form where you can add your **name and student number!**\n\n[https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_80qioGFW7mbrmFU](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_80qioGFW7mbrmFU)",

If you check my history, then you will see my only other post where I was encouraging the student to take the necessary steps to submit a complaint to the university about this situation as absolutely no student should be made to feel uncomfortable on campus!\n\nI can definitely appreciate the reluctance by many to submit a complaint, as there is generally a host of feelings, concerns, etc., that goes through one's mind in terms of whether they should or should not; however, when action is not taken issues like this always seem to perpetuate...your post is clearly a great case in point.\n\nThis is all leading me to say two things: 1) please, please, please do take immediate action as noted by others and clearly supported by me, as that is the only way to prevent your fellow and future classmates from experiencing similar situations; and 2) as noted in my other post, I am staff at UBC and if you feel uncomfortable in any way about raising this issue to the university, the please do feel free to DM me, I can provide you my contact information on campus and hopefully provide you with additional guidance on people you can speak to.",

I remember when I was in like 7th grade I was unconsciously tapping the back of someone's chair and when I realized I felt so fucking bad, but it's completely unconscious. Sometimes I wont notice I'm causing an earthquake until my boyfriend physically holds my leg down lmaoo. I'm sure the leg bouncer in your class isn't purposely trying to piss you off lol, they are probably just as stressed and anxious as you are( if not more). Their brain just copes with it in a different way! I understand your grievances. I'm sure it's annoying and I don't agree with how the other guy was being snarky with you .

I was sceptical that a person could generate so much movement/vibration/noise without realizing, but I believe you. It really was more of a vent post because honestly especially during an exam or something, someone moving the entire row is very distracting. So thanks for not just saying “people with adhd have every right to distract you so get over it.” I think that I have a lot of inattentive adhd symptoms and this is why it’s so distracting to me. Probably someone with a “normal” brain wouldn’t A. Fidget or B. Be super distracted by fidgeting.

Personally I think the UBCCard money is best because you can use it at Foodhub and that’s the cheapest way of buying groceries, however they have limited selection. The swipes is honestly terrible in terms of how much you’re getting and I hate dining hall food. But I can see how it would be useful for someone who doesn’t have a kitchen.",

No assignment is worth neglecting your self care and Hopefully must people you talk to will confirm That.

When I was Undergrad Chair in Mathematics, I never tracked missed midterms, but in MATH courses I'd see 2 or 3 cases of this per year for final exams. (We have \\~20 000 students writing exams, so it's not that common.)\n\nSome (most?) professors will be sympathetic.  They may give you a chance to write a midterm or they may re-weight the midterm to the final exam.\n\nYour faculty advising office will do nothing when you miss a midterm or a final exam for reasons like sleeping in or writing down the wrong date on your calendar. They will refer to you to your instructor.  For final exams, this used to drive me a bit nuts  because it throws the decision as to whether a student will be able to write a final exam for their course back onto the instructor.  It's the main instance in which the Dean's Office doesn't make a decision on a deferred exam and an SD is not possible because of this.\n\nI never had an instructor let a student fail because of missing their final exam for this reason, but it does add extra work because the student isn't granted an SD so the matter needs to be settled in a fairly quick timeframe.",

        "selftext": "Has anyone noticed that the commuter hostels are getting more difficult to book?\n\nLast year (2022/2023) you could get a room somewhere between 30-40 a night. This year those rooms haven’t been available, just the 70 dollar private rooms. \n\nJust last semester I could book a room the day of, which was very useful as I often find myself too tired to drive home after a days class mixed with an all nighter from studying for tests the night before (my bus is too long and unfortunately I get motion sickness so I need to drive). But today, I went in to the front desk of the hostel after the website told me I should call to book and was very rudely told that they don’t rent rooms the day of. And when I questioned it, as that was not my experience just a month and a half ago, they told me to leave… which was a lot as I am so tired and also recovering from a flu but had to force myself to come to school so I wouldn’t miss my lab. I feel like the point of the commuter hostel was for scenarios such as this but they are becoming less accessible….\n\nSorry ended up ranting… just wondering if anyone else is getting frustrated by the commuter hostel… who should I reach out to about reinstating the cheaper rooms and keeping check in days to day of?",

            "Yep, it was quite a saviour during my undergrad. Commute was around 2 hours so having an 8AM exam after getting off late night classes was abysmal and sleeping over at a dorm was impossible for me to get sleep. \n\nOne downside at the time was no wifi but they’ve fixed that since.

My role was advertised as one where I would work fairly independently and would be able to pick up whatever projects interested me as long as my core responsibilities were fulfilled. So, doing the research was helpful to get a better idea of what some of these projects could be.",

Don’t make assumptions on stuff you don’t know. \n\nGo into interviews as if you’re meeting a friend you haven’t seen in 10 years and both of you are getting to know what you’ve been up to. Polite but human is the approach. The interviewer (in a healthy work environment) will know the reason you want that job is to make money to survive, so be honest about previous work environments you don’t fit in. \n\nMy job offers surprisingly came from companies who I was frankly honest with. They asked why I’m leaving my current job, I tell them nothing wrong with coworkers, I get along with people, but it’s for my personal development (sounded selfish, but always works).",

Make sure you include the course codes, weightings, profs, and contact info for profs. \n\nYou should think about what concessions you want, like extended deadlines or just excusing the assignments. Typically I had no problem getting anything I asked for. Your advisor will contact the profs on your behalf for the concessions, but depending on what concessions you get your profs may want to follow up with you wrt where the extra weighting goes. \n\nYour profs have no business getting upset with you as your request is coming through the CFA. If they do get short with you, stop speaking to them and only use your advisor as a mediator. Only thing is your profs should already know you're with the CFA as you're supposed to send them your accommodations letter. If you haven't done that yet, email it to them now and just apologize for the lateness since you're new to the whole thing."

I've noticed I have struggled a lot with making friends here too, especially since high school, as many students (including myself) become very busy and easily stressed about school priorities, which in turn bleed into social relationships. \n\nThere is no simple way to \"make\" friends, but understand your worth and know that you are valued. If you are finding that your current friendships do not feel reciprocal, it may be worth trying to communicate your feelings with them. Or, if you feel like you cannot, phasing out these friendships and attempt to find new ones. There is no sure way of making \"new\" friends, but definitely avoid isolating yourself... pay attention to your interests and the things that make you happy, and see if you can find other people in your classes, in clubs, etc., that share those values, and push yourself to go out and participate in those things. \n\nObviously this is all just my opinion, so do whatever strategy feels right to you. Point is, these feelings are quite valid and relatable.",

You could also google search some \"school program application\" interview questions to practice as well. Another good strategy is to use the STAR method (situation, task, action, result) for behavioural/role play questions.

But Trump handled Covid-19 terribly, he was impeached twice: first in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for his dealings with Zelensky to blackmail Biden, and again in January 2021 for incitement of insurrection following the Capitol riot. Plus 4 criminal indictments in 2023, and 91 criminal charges pending as of right now. Not to mention his awful handling of children at the border, or all shit he’s said about grabbing women.

I also tend to see that most friend group among international students comes from where they come from but even that has been hard for me, I come from India but never lived there grew up in the middle east in a very international school so I feel bit out of place in these groups based on where you come from. Equally from Vancouver are mostly commuters or people who still have the their high school friends and not looking to meet new people.

'A group of students discuss existing, public approaches to a problem presented as an assignment' is pretty broad and most problems in undergrad CS courses can be solved using existing, public approaches. \n\nThe phrase 'solving problems with outside assistance' is also pretty vague, and it's not clear that (by the standards of the CS department as you've pasted above) working with a student not in the class qualifies as 'outside' assistance. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that when you turn in the assignment, if you've mastered all of the relevant concepts, no one's going to care too much how you got there, unless you're stupid enough to directly plagiarize your assignment. Hacked a neural implant into your brain and literally downloaded the textbook? Fine. Worked with a group of other students and solved the questions together? If you can, alone, in a room with a whiteboard and a prof, reproduce and explain the answers you got (and expand upon them to demonstrate that you've actually understood the material) no one is going to give a shit. \n\nIs a tutor outside assistance? Someone who's taking a similar course? Someone taking the same course? Someone who passed the course? There's no clear line other than representing someone else's work as your own, but even then, the definition of someone else's work is sufficiently muddy and difficult to test that personal mastery is a much more straightforward standard.",

That means the same style of stall is being installed by any number of contractors, all with varying skill and effort (it’s likely bathroom stall installation is one of the jobs given to the least experienced guys on a crew). That means the stalls are designed with the idea they are super easy to install; so easy, it doesn’t matter who does it. Super easy installation+cheap=very large tolerances (you can “screw up” quite a bit, and the stalls will still work). Large tolerances=large gaps",

By you personally taking a flight, you're essentially increasing the frequency that that route will be taken by whatever fractional amount an individual customer represents to the airline. You're still 1/170th of the passengers on an airplane, so you're 1/170th responsible for the emissions of the flight (somewhat less directly true with airlines that are paid to haul cargo as well...again...more convoluted, but still basically true) There's no free lunch here. \n\nThis is true for every economy, domestic route that is always full, because it's not profitable if it's not full. \"The flights are gonna happen regardless\" is only true for much more expensive flights that can be financially viable without being full, or like...ghost flights, where the flight has to happen for bureaucratic reasons rather than economic demand.  \n\nEven then, it's not without added emissions, as increasing the weight of the aircraft increases fuel usage.",

Not merely 2 hours. \n\nSecond, how much do you pay to park at or Uber to/from YYC?\n\nThird, you don’t just show up to each airport five minutes before departure. You’re showing up at least 40-60 minutes before the departure time of each flight. You’re doing that twice each school day. \n\nFourth, how much do you pay to get to UBC once you’ve landed at YVR? And then back to YVR? And how long does that take roundtrip?\n\nFifth, merely going from “entering an airport” to getting to your gate — and vice versa — is always a 10-15 minute walk at least.

Even at minimum wage, it would take only around 25hrs/month to make up that $400 difference, which is around the same amount of time you'd save on commuting by living in Vancouver. No disrespect to your decisions, but it seems like you must simply enjoy flying or living with your family / in Calgary. You also are massively impaired from involvement in campus culture / clubs.

I ask because getting Nexus and SA gold isn't trivial at all, the former of which takes an entire year, and the latter you'd have to fly a bunch with Star Alliance airlines (and the easiest way for Canadians, if I'm not wrong, is to get Aeroplan 50k elite status that involves spending at least $6000 on flights and 50000 SQM or 50 SQS, i.e. you need deep pockets, or buy a status pass off of a Super Elite member).\n\nAlso, I assume you live in the northern half of Calgary that doesn't involve a lengthy drive to the airport? Time on plane gate to gate (1 hour) + time spent in both airports walking between boarding gate and entrance/exit along with security check (10 minutes) + time on skytrain and bus (40 minutes) + time walking between bus loop and classroom door (5 minutes) by my very conservative estimate, still takes nearly 2 hours. Not arguing with you here though, it's just that I've done the YYC - YVR route myself plenty of times, and door to door between destinations it still takes a good 4-5 hours for myself, so I'm impressed with your efficiency.",
